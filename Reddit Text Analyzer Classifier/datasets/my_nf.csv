My kid did something I can't figure out how to undo pls help,"My son, 4, had his own profile that I specifically went through and blacklisted certain shows I didn't want him to watch and was set to age appropriate content. The 3 other profiles are password protected so he can't get in them. But he figured out how to edit profiles... like change the names and pictures delete and add. He could do this on both his Amazon Fire and the PS4.

So. He treats adding and deleting profiles like a game. No matter how many times his dad and I tell him to NOT change profiles he continues do do it. He knows he isn't supposed to because whenever he creates a new one he will show you all coy like. Consequently I signed out of Netflix on his tablet and tried to limit his PS4 controller access. It had been a while since I signed him out on his tablet so I decided to give him another chance. Yada Yada Yada never trust a 4 year old now I have this problem.

He seems to have deleted his specifically curated kids profile. He added 2 new profiles and put something in Malaysian which I think I finally was able to put back in English. I have tried deleting the profiles on the app on the PS4 but after I press delete nothing happens... they are still there. I have used the website for full account controlls and when I go to delete there I am met with an error code. Why won't they delete??

Editing to add:
- The PS4 is my husband's not my son's. It is how the family watches TV in the living room

-My son doesn't have unlimited access to electronics all day but when he does have access to Netflix it was nice having a kids profile set for him to block garbage like Cocomelon and the like

-He has had more screen time this week specifically because I'm a SAHM and I also have a 1 year old and this week I have been ungodly sick with a sinus infection.  Normally we go to the library for story time once a week, go to the playground every day it isn't too hot, and I am teaching him prek lessons at home. The week I'm just trying to survive without my head exploding.

-I have resigned myself to just accepting there is no deleting these 2 extra profiles so I can't remake the kids one. Netflix is now signed out on his tablet and he no longer has independent access to it.",238,0.82,150,MysteriousMonarch,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1694195063.0,False,False,False,2023-09-08 17:44:23,my son had his own profile that i specifically went through and blacklisted certain shows i didnt want him to watch and was set to age appropriate content the other profiles are password protected so he cant get in them but he figured out how to edit profiles like change the names and pictures delete and add he could do this on both his amazon fire and the ps so he treats adding and deleting profiles like a game no matter how many times his dad and i tell him to not change profiles he continues do do it he knows he isnt supposed to because whenever he creates a new one he will show you all coy like consequently i signed out of netflix on his tablet and tried to limit his ps controller access it had been a while since i signed him out on his tablet so i decided to give him another chance yada yada yada never trust a year old now i have this problem he seems to have deleted his specifically curated kids profile he added new profiles and put something in malaysian which i think i finally was able to put back in english i have tried deleting the profiles on the app on the ps but after i press delete nothing happens they are still there i have used the website for full account controlls and when i go to delete there i am met with an error code why wont they delete editing to add the ps is my husbands not my sons it is how the family watches tv in the living room my son doesnt have unlimited access to electronics all day but when he does have access to netflix it was nice having a kids profile set for him to block garbage like cocomelon and the like he has had more screen time this week specifically because im a sahm and i also have a year old and this week i have been ungodly sick with a sinus infection normally we go to the library for story time once a week go to the playground every day it isnt too hot and i am teaching him prek lessons at home the week im just trying to survive without my head exploding i have resigned myself to just accepting there is no deleting these extra profiles so i cant remake the kids one netflix is now signed out on his tablet and he no longer has independent access to it,my kid did something i cant figure out how to undo pls help,0

Strange stuff happening while applying at Netflix,"Has anyone faced the following before?

So I have applied at the Netflix Careers portal for the New Grad Software Engineer position. The portal says the application will be considered complete only after I fill an Airtable form that I receive after submitting my application.

But here's the catch. As soon as I submit my application, I get an email saying my application has been received. But at the exact same instant, my friend, who hasn't even applied gets an email with the Airtable form to be filled, *addressed to his name*.

I cannot make sense of this as my friend's name/email address is nowhere mentioned in my application/resume/cover letter.
I applied again, this time with my university email, but the same thing happened. My friend got the form link.

"Just finished the final season of Top Boy, and I've got some thoughts... (Spoilers of course)","This was by far the weakest season for me. It just felt rushed. Too many plot points weren't fully addressed.

* Aaron really left his little brother to grow up in a home and fend for himself, after they'd both just witnessed their big bro get killed by Sully. That just feels so wrong to me. Family was such a big thing for them, yet man really just decided to fuck off to Leeds without Stef...
* What happened to Stef's friend Tia? She was literally walking by when Sully killed Jamie, yet there was no mention of her in this season.
* We never even got to see a funeral for Jamie or any of the aftermath. 
* What was actually the point of bringing the Irish gangsters in? What did they actually do? They were introduced as this big bad force and were just offed in 2 episodes. Why not at least link them to Lizzie to give them some more relevance?
* What the fuck happened to Dushane's heart problems that they were building up over the last couple seasons? Literally nothing came of it.
* Dushane also just seemed so fucking stupid here. Why would this guy just leave Jeffrey's body where it was after killing him? He could've easily gotten the crew to help deal with it. Not like it's the first dead body they've had to deal with. Did bro just think that his DNA and fingerprints would magically disappear?
* Jaq stealing the drugs was such a dumb thing to do. why get Kierron involved as well?
* Sully shooting Dushane just felt weird to me man. Dushane has saved his life so many fucking times, yet no one ever brings that up when they're arguing. If anything, I would've preferred Dushane to die from a heart attack when they were talking with the wall between them.

Why Netflix is bound to be a more successful streaming platform than individual company streaming platforms,"Despite companies opting to take their content off Netflix in favour of starting their own streaming platforms, most separate streaming companies that offer their own stuff fail to even turn a profit. Disney+ is the most notable example of this, as even with having the most successful entertainment IP’s in history they have yet to turn a profit on Disney+.

But why is this?

First and foremost, let’s follow the money.

In recent years, most of Disney’s newer entertainment projects have been duds or bombs. “Lightyear” just made its money back in terms of its production but lost hundreds of millions from marketing and failed merchandise. “Strange World” left the theatres as quickly and quietly as it entered. “The Little Mermaid” had some success but still lost out after marketing and promotional costs. And we can all guess where the new live-action Snow White is going…

But what has been making money?

“Top Gun: Maverick”, and the “Super Mario Bros. Movie”.

Each of these films quickly amassed over $1B USD globally the moment they came out into theatres. Even now, they’re still being watched and widely talked about, yet most other new movies made by other companies have been mostly forgotten.

So what’s the difference between these movies and Disney’s movies?

**Put simply, Top Gun: Maverick and Mario offered newer content that was high quality and even revolutionary.** What was done in Top Gun: Maverick had never been done before in cinematic history, and there’s never been an animated cinematic release of Mario. But most importantly, they took the time to make these films truly amazing and worth the ticket price.

**Meanwhile, Disney is failing to create truly new and high quality original content.** They keep releasing remakes and reboots that ultimately just rehash the elements of past successes without offering anything new, and they keep making them so fast that their quality has gone downhill.

**In other words, people want high quality content that’s never been done before.**

This is why Netflix is primed for success in the streaming platform wars.

Instead of amassing a whole bunch of franchises, they mostly allow numerous production companies to host their content on their platform. This allows them to constantly offer newer yet still high quality content on the regular, and switch out older or non-desirable content with new stuff.

This is a must in the streaming world as the convenience of streaming also means that consumers watch stuff faster and more regularly, yet their appetite is never fully satisfied.

On the other hand, companies like Disney+ and Paramount+ can only offer their own content, and because they’ve invested so much into their own franchises they can only offer content from those franchises. Yet as can easily be seen in recent box office performances, people have already gotten sick of content from those franchises.

This puts them between a rock and a hard place; they need to keep making more and newer stuff to keep up with streaming demands, yet they can’t make anything truly new because they’ve already invested so much into the franchises they’ve acquired.

**In conclusion, Netflix is destined to be the king of streaming for a long time. The demands for streaming services is for frequent, new, and high quality content, and they’re really only one of the few streaming services on the market that can meet that demand.**",5,0.63,3,fortifier22,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1694125133.0,False,False,False,2023-09-07 22:18:53,despite companies opting to take their content off netflix in favour of starting their own streaming platforms most separate streaming companies that offer their own stuff fail to even turn a profit disney is the most notable example of this as even with having the most successful entertainment ips in history they have yet to turn a profit on disney but why is this first and foremost lets follow the money in recent years most of disneys newer entertainment projects have been duds or bombs lightyear just made its money back in terms of its production but lost hundreds of millions from marketing and failed merchandise strange world left the theatres as quickly and quietly as it entered the little mermaid had some success but still lost out after marketing and promotional costs and we can all guess where the new liveaction snow white is going but what has been making money top gun maverick and the super mario bros movie each of these films quickly amassed over b usd globally the moment they came out into theatres even now theyre still being watched and widely talked about yet most other new movies made by other companies have been mostly forgotten so whats the difference between these movies and disneys movies put simply top gun maverick and mario offered newer content that was high quality and even revolutionary what was done in top gun maverick had never been done before in cinematic history and theres never been an animated cinematic release of mario but most importantly they took the time to make these films truly amazing and worth the ticket price meanwhile disney is failing to create truly new and high quality original content they keep releasing remakes and reboots that ultimately just rehash the elements of past successes without offering anything new and they keep making them so fast that their quality has gone downhill in other words people want high quality content thats never been done before this is why netflix is primed for success in the streaming platform wars instead of amassing a whole bunch of franchises they mostly allow numerous production companies to host their content on their platform this allows them to constantly offer newer yet still high quality content on the regular and switch out older or nondesirable content with new stuff this is a must in the streaming world as the convenience of streaming also means that consumers watch stuff faster and more regularly yet their appetite is never fully satisfied on the other hand companies like disney and paramount can only offer their own content and because theyve invested so much into their own franchises they can only offer content from those franchises yet as can easily be seen in recent box office performances people have already gotten sick of content from those franchises this puts them between a rock and a hard place they need to keep making more and newer stuff to keep up with streaming demands yet they cant make anything truly new because theyve already invested so much into the franchises theyve acquired in conclusion netflix is destined to be the king of streaming for a long time the demands for streaming services is for frequent new and high quality content and theyre really only one of the few streaming services on the market that can meet that demand,why netflix is bound to be a more successful streaming platform than individual company streaming platforms,0

"Evangelion: I highly recommend watching the show, but skip to the movie before the ending.","I do think there's something about purists, and I'm guilty of it myself, wanting to see something for what it originally was, but there are a couple of reasons why Neon Genesis Evangelion is worth watching without its entirety and then seeing the End of Evangelion movie instead of the show's ending.

**Reason 1: The movie is the ending to the show**

The movie End of Evangelion is a literal replacement of Episode 25 and Episode 26 from the show. It provides the adventure a more tangible and consistent finale with everything that came before. The show -- I won't spoil it to any newbies -- ends with a very, very subversive and *odd* finale that feels jarring from the moment you start watching the 25th episode.

**Reason 2: It's more climactic**

While I don't actually mind the show's ""original"" ending, the movie provides a better escalation of all the mystery and buildup from prior in the show. It culminates in one great out of body experience and a provocative, thoughtful finale that people still debate and interpret to this day.

**Reason 3: The movie is not actually a total rewrite**

It's not actually true to say it ""replaces"" or ""changes"" the ending. The truth behind the development of the series is that the studio behind it ran into some production issues halfway into the show, and by the time they reached Episode 21 they were so behind schedule that the ""Next Week on Evangelion!"" preview started showing storyboard doodles instead of the preview of completed moments. There's a snippet of storyboard between Episode 24 and 25 that show the rough sketches of a moment that doesn't even happen in Episode 25, but it happens in the movie. For those that see Ep25 of the show, you'll also witness a few still-frames that seem disjointed to the episode itself and make you go ""Did that really happen in the real story?"" and they're ultimately shown in the EoE movie. In interviews the showrunners later admitted that they had complete storyboards for Episode 25 and was well into Episode 26 when they realized they couldn't make it on time, along with some TV-station disagreements about the content, and they had to think on the fly in very, very short time in the last 3 episodes of the show, to the point where they had to scrap the completed storyboard of Ep25 and incomplete storyboard of 26 and make a completely alternative ending using whatever resources they had left. They knew a while before the 25th episode airing that they wanted Episode 26 to be very ""different"", so their choice in the end was to make Ep25 like Ep26 in its oddity, and the result is that the NGE show literally abandons the finale of its *plot* between Episode 24 and 25, and leaves you with a ""headspace"" ending that provides some thematic closure instead of revealing the fates of everyone you followed. The movie, however, tells basically the same message whilist providing that closure as a *plot*.

**Reason 4: You can always watch the show's ending afterwards**

In fact, with EoE you might be left with some questions too. And the movie is also a bit more grimdark than the show. And the show's ending ends on a pretty overtly positive note, and feels like a decent post-scriptum to the movie's finale.

Lastly, I highly recommend watching this series. Even if you don't like anime, there's a cinematic quality to Evangelion that is rare for the media, and although I do think it suffers a bit in plot and character arc at times, there was something about Eva that made it feel unmissable once I started watching it. If you're bored and looking for something to remember on Netflix, I recommend this franchise, and watching the End of Evangelion movie after you close out Episode 24.",3,0.6,3,linkenski,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1694107993.0,False,False,False,2023-09-07 17:33:13,i do think theres something about purists and im guilty of it myself wanting to see something for what it originally was but there are a couple of reasons why neon genesis evangelion is worth watching without its entirety and then seeing the end of evangelion movie instead of the shows ending reason the movie is the ending to the show the movie end of evangelion is a literal replacement of episode and episode from the show it provides the adventure a more tangible and consistent finale with everything that came before the show i wont spoil it to any newbies ends with a very very subversive and odd finale that feels jarring from the moment you start watching the th episode reason its more climactic while i dont actually mind the shows original ending the movie provides a better escalation of all the mystery and buildup from prior in the show it culminates in one great out of body experience and a provocative thoughtful finale that people still debate and interpret to this day reason the movie is not actually a total rewrite its not actually true to say it replaces or changes the ending the truth behind the development of the series is that the studio behind it ran into some production issues halfway into the show and by the time they reached episode they were so behind schedule that the next week on evangelion preview started showing storyboard doodles instead of the preview of completed moments theres a snippet of storyboard between episode and that show the rough sketches of a moment that doesnt even happen in episode but it happens in the movie for those that see ep of the show youll also witness a few stillframes that seem disjointed to the episode itself and make you go did that really happen in the real story and theyre ultimately shown in the eoe movie in interviews the showrunners later admitted that they had complete storyboards for episode and was well into episode when they realized they couldnt make it on time along with some tvstation disagreements about the content and they had to think on the fly in very very short time in the last episodes of the show to the point where they had to scrap the completed storyboard of ep and incomplete storyboard of and make a completely alternative ending using whatever resources they had left they knew a while before the th episode airing that they wanted episode to be very different so their choice in the end was to make ep like ep in its oddity and the result is that the nge show literally abandons the finale of its plot between episode and and leaves you with a headspace ending that provides some thematic closure instead of revealing the fates of everyone you followed the movie however tells basically the same message whilist providing that closure as a plot reason you can always watch the shows ending afterwards in fact with eoe you might be left with some questions too and the movie is also a bit more grimdark than the show and the shows ending ends on a pretty overtly positive note and feels like a decent postscriptum to the movies finale lastly i highly recommend watching this series even if you dont like anime theres a cinematic quality to evangelion that is rare for the media and although i do think it suffers a bit in plot and character arc at times there was something about eva that made it feel unmissable once i started watching it if youre bored and looking for something to remember on netflix i recommend this franchise and watching the end of evangelion movie after you close out episode,evangelion i highly recommend watching the show but skip to the movie before the ending,0

Ragnarok S3 Ending- What Really Happened?,"This post is full of spoilers;

&#x200B;

Ok, so I get that none of the Norse mythology stuff really happened and Magne was mentally ill... The problem with this ending is that it leaves SO many questions about what actually was going on in the real world at the time, it seems like some of it must have happened but there's no way a lot of it did. Some of it is easy enough to figure out like Vidar really died but not from getting bashed in the head with an ancient axe but probably from a heart attack or something. It seems most of the characters could have known eachother by protests they participated in or something like that I guess.

\-Did Magne actually discover evidence of the Jutul's environmental pollution?

\-Did Magne really bash Vidar's windshield with his mother's hammer?

\-Did Magne really murder the Jutul's family dog on a school camping trip?

\-Did Fjor piss on Isolde's memorial?

\-Did Magne confront Fjor and his father over trying to hurt Gry? Did Magne actually tell Fjor he killed his father?

\-Was Lauritz really Vidar's illegitimate son? Lauritz is a couple years younger than Magne and they look probably 6 and 8 respectively in that photo with their father so the mother would have had to have conceived Lauritz with Vidar a couple years after having Magne with his father, the timelines don't really add up.

\-Did any of the romantic relationship between Saxa and Magne actually happen or was the entire thing in his mind? Including his mother's wedding?

\-Was there really goat blood on Isolde's jacket? Did her cause of death change several times?

\-To what extent did Magne actually bully, threaten, visit or even interact with the Jutul's in any way? And did Ran actually bump his grades up? If so, why?

\-How did Magne survive so long without his prescription eyeglasses?

\-Was Freya actually a reality TV star/influencer and did Tyr really lose his hand and survive to become the world's portliest paralympian?

Why are streaming shows much more downbeat and unhappy?,"This is very general I know that, and it actually has nothing to do with quality or IMO even freedom of expression (even though they indeed have more creative freedom, I think there is something more to what I am talking about than that). I get all the advantages that come with having more creative freedom and being able to swear/show more gore/nudity, etc but that's different from what I am actually saying I think, because you can have all these exact things but not necessarily have a dystopian and nihilistic TV show. In modern streaming shows there are usually not moments like in  X-Files, Twin Peaks, or Star Trek: Next Gen where something is given a sense of resolved semi-happy closure or ending to certain plotlines now and then?

The Lincoln Lawyer is one recent exception to this on Netflix. Of course, there are very serious and real, depressing moments/revelations, but it quickly moves on to another plotline where something else gets resolved more happily, or bittersweet maybe.

What I have noticed is shows that aren't on Network TV or Cable (for all their faults) are much more focused on just  constant nihilism and doom and gloom every step of the way, beating you down mentally with how much bad it can get ""You think that's depressing?  Hold my beer"". It's just a trend related to streaming I don't understand and doesn't make sense to me.

Like I said, my gripe has nothing to do with quality of any of these shows or anything like that, but basically shows on Streaming have a tendency to put me in a bad mood (even if they're better than what you see on both Network/Cable)?

Welcome to Eden,"The worst thing about the current Netflix paradigm is that a series is often dropped before being concluded.

For example, 'Welcome to Eden,' which I've been enjoying a lot, has been dropped after only two seasons. 

This has happened to me numerous times now and makes me wonder what the point of watching a new series is, if you know there's a good chance you won't see get to see how it all works out in the end.

I personally think Netflix shouldn't put a series to air unless they're going to wrap it up. At the very least, there should be a movie-length concluding episode.

Choose love all possible endings,"UPDATE: Reddit sleuths have found more endings so I am listing all the actual ending scenes below (count is currently at 10, some with small variations) because maybe there are 16 of those? Comment if you find more!

* Gets engaged to Paul in LA right after talking to her boss and he gives her a battery and then does a magic trick with the ring (get there via scenario 1 below)
* Get married to Paul in Vegas in silly clothes with Rex as a witness and her sister and BIL on the phone (scenarios 2, 5 and 12). 
**Variations:** In scenario 2, the ring reveal (""That's the one from the escape room!"") happens here and the sister ends the scene with ""kidding!"" In both scenarios 5 and 12, Rex ends the scene with ""or is it?"" but in scenario 5, Paul still puts the ring on her finger during the ceremony; in scenario 12, she already has it on.
* Ends up alone playing slots with the psychic (scenario 3)
* Her and Jack ""choose"" each other but makes him agree the door to babies is open (scenario 4). 
**Variation:** She also tells him he's her dream come true if she asks for good news in the first scene of the movie
* Goes to Paris with Rex and they kiss on the balcony (scenario 6, 8, and 13, and 15)
* Tells Rex she's imagining someone else and tells Jack she never stopped loving him (scenario 7 and 9)
* Paul calls her at the protest and she goes back to LA. He thinks she's a burglar and is on the phone with 911 while he proposes (scenario 10 if she didn't tell Paul about Jack in the escape room)
* Paul calls her at the protest and proposes over the phone, she goes back to LA and they get engaged in the escape room (scenario 10 if she did tell Paul about Jack in the escape room)
* Paul calls her at the protest and Jack asks her if she wants to go after him and she asks how long it took him to get over her and he says ""I'll let you know"" and her and Jack decide to take it ""a day at a time"" (scenario 11)
* She tells Rex she wants to be his producer and not date and leaves the door open for at least 2 romantic relationships (sometimes she's fully rejected Paul, sometimes she just didn't call him) (scenarios 14 and 16)


All the articles I can find describe 6 endings but I saw more than that. Scott Michael Foster said there are 16. I guess maybe it depends on how you define ""ending."" I've identified 9 final scenes (3 with Paul, 3 with Jack, 2 with Rex and one alone) with 16 ways to get there (5 to Paul, 4 to Jack, 4 to Rex, and 3 ""other""), so I think I found them all?

1. Picks Paul in dream, gets engaged in LA

2. Picks Jack in dream, stays with him after Rex offers gig, Paul shows up and proposes; she says yes and they get married in Vegas.

3. Picks Jack in dream, stays with him after Rex offers gig, Paul shows up and proposes; she says no and picks Jack? but then decides to be alone.

4. Picks Jack in dream, stays with him after Rex offers gig, Paul shows up and proposes; she says no and picks Jack? and then decides to be with him.

5. Picks Jack in dream, and goes with Rex when he offers the gig, she returns Paul's call and accepts his proposal; they get married in Vegas.

6. Picks Jack in dream, and goes with Rex when he offers the gig; returns Paul's call and then rejects his proposal; ends up in Paris with Rex.

7. Picks Jack in dream, and goes with Rex when he offers the gig; returns Paul's call and then rejects his proposal; rejects Rex and tells Jack she's never stopped loving him.

8. Picks Jack in dream, and goes with Rex when he offers the gig; doesn't return Paul's call; ends up in Paris with Rex.

9. Picks Jack in dream, and goes with Rex when he offers the gig; doesn't return Paul's call; rejects Rex and tells Jack she's never stopped loving him.

10. Picks Rex in dream but chooses to protest with Jack; Paul calls and she goes to back to LA; gets engaged in LA after he thinks she's a burglar.

11. Picks Rex in dream but chooses to protest with Jack; Paul calls and she doesn't go back to LA; her and Jack kiss and take it ""a day at a time.""

12. She picks Rex in the dream and decides to sing; she doesn't protest and calls Paul who comes to support her; they get married in Vegas.

13. She picks Rex in the dream and decides to sing; she doesn't protest or call Paul (or calls Paul and rejects him); she ends up in Paris with Rex.

14. She picks Rex in the dream and decides to sing; she doesn't protest or call Paul (or calls Paul and rejects him); she tells Rex she wants to keep their relationship professional. (This one leaves her romantic relationship ambiguous.)

15. She picks Rex in the dream and decides not to sing (doesn't matter if she calls Paul if she doesn't choose to sing); she doesn't protest and ends up in Paris with Rex.

One Piece Live Action thoughts,"So at this point save for Season 2 announcement due to the strikes, the LA has been a success. What I’ve noticed from fans in both this subreddit and big YouTubers, is that their main complaints is that is not 1:1 (think of Harry Potter when he fought the Dragon or Dumbledore speaking “calmly” in the goblet of fire). 

A majority of fans like it while the more unforgiving ones hate it due to not 1 to 1. However, it has been generally quite positive for completely blind viewers on this subreddit and general movie/tv show reviewers on YouTube, and that is a HUGE understated success. 

I think the biggest contrast to show my point is Grandlinereview’s criticisms and MrMorj’s criticism. If you want to see the point of view of a newcomer, try the channel Dan Murrel who bases his channel in movies reviews as well as box office analyses and has recently reviewed One Piece LA.

Honestly if we get more seasons and as long the newcomers like it, does critically well, and the adaption is equal to or better than the 1st season, then im going to treat the anime and manga fans like how I treat Harry Potter fans. Ignore and only listen to them if you want to know how it really went down in the source material, because for its medium, it’s excellent.

Why are new fantasy shows so dark (low light)?,"I'm watching ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" at the moment and I have trouble seeing what's going on because a lot of the scenes set at night are so dark that the contrast of my TV can't keep up.

I'm down to a point where I can only watch shows like that in the evening after the sunset to properly enjoy them, which is kind of annoying since I work shifts. 
Why do producers do that? I get that they want to set a mood but what's the point if you can't see the scene properly?

(Before everybody comments I should check my TV settings: The contrast option already is at 50/50 and adjusting the brightness doesn't really help. The sun isn't shining directly through the window and I don't have trouble watching anything else from other genres like comedy.

Request subtitles or audio in different languages,"Is there some way to request different languages, subtitles or audio to be available in your country?

Anyway, I like demon slayer, so I was happy when I found it on Netflix. Turns out, it's only available in Japanese and french? Both in audio and subtitles. I've watched it before with English subtitles so they obviously exist. Why does Netflix not make them available?

God what a waste of time this was. Surprisingly the worst of the season. Basically these guys just listen to people tell whatever fantastical story they want to and then call that “investigating”. 

There was literally not one shred of interesting or valuable evidence presented for ANYTHING they talked about. They would call pretty much everything dangerous or deadly and then tell not a SINGLE story about anyone getting even slightly injured, let alone killed. 

What annoyed me the most is I’m actually a believer in things like life on other planets and unexplained phenomena.

Last night in Soho - Netflix what's with these horrible filters!!,"Another film using terrible filters to simulate it being shot in the 60's

It looks nothing like film from the sixties.

It's a 4k stream, which should look sharp and crisp.

But instead, we get this checkerboard pattern over every thing

Even the Title screen, and text is all square checkerboard.

Certain shots emphasize this, look at the Coca cola can, in one shot.  It's terrible pixelated, does not resemble anything, from film, from the 60's

Look at the edges of things, faces, arms, anything with a straight line, is transformed into a Blocky checkered board edge.

Blurred images in the background, just look like a low-resolution mess.

This artistic direction, had me just looking for more of this all the way through the movie.

CHOOSE your own LOVE adventure,"********Spoiler alert*********
This is a response I wrote to https://www.thedailybeast.com/choose-love-review-netflixs-interactive-rom-com-is-a-waste

who said that Netflix's new #interactive feature doesn't really let you choose different outcomes. It does... I want to know if there are more potential outcomes than the 4 I found! 

***********SPOILERS*************

Fletcher,
I watched Choose Love last night and immediately went back to check all the rabbit holes, the way we did back when we read Choose Your Own Adventure books. Of course the plot line to Paul is the easiest. So, I went back and made a decision to choose Rex. Got Rex in Paris. Now getting Cami to choose Jack was where it got interesting! Not only did the show keep putting obstacles and opportunities in her way to make it nearly impossible... But when I finally did get to the final option to choose the ending with him, it presented what I think you are calling the Easter egg. It gives Cami the option to be alone! Then the tarot reappears and you see Cami about to win a slot machine!
...What's hilarious is that Jack is the one choice you can choose where Paul walks right across the screen and says, ""Really? Because he's so good looking?"" and challenges you to make a better decision ""next time"". I think it's because he is the past, and you already walked away from each other before. Cami is moving forward in her career, one that will no doubt require interactions with people like sleezy hotel owners and questionable pop stars. What's amazing is the show doesn't pass any judgement or hint at the possibility of a tryst with Rex being an impulsive fling. It just lets you decide that's where you are right now...
I know most of the options seem unimportant to the plot line, but I found what was enjoyable about this kind of entertainment was that it let me keep Cami a likable relatable character, sort of. I wasn't mentally sabotaging her the first time around because I made the decisions I felt good about... Unlike, say Carrie Bradshaw, who is so frequently unlikable that you sort of root for her to crash and burn. 

Anyway, I was surprised there was so little content to read about this show... And in case you couldn't find your way around Paul, maybe consider what that means about how you choose...

Netflix supported languages,"I'm an American who currently lives just across the border in Mexico and I've come across what I regard as a *serious* problem with Netflix and it's supported languages.

There are a *TON* of shows, and anime's in particular that Netflix offers with solely Spanish audio.

What the hell, Netflix? I know for a fact there's an English dub for One Piece the anime, because it was one of the first ones ever done. Why is this not being offered here? It most certainly is being offered in the US. And I'd bet dollars to donuts the Spanish dub is being offered in the US as well. How hard is it to give me, an American, who by the way is paying American prices for Netflix(an American company) access to a dub in English?

And frankly, as a student of a couple other languages, I want those too!

All I'm saying is if Netflix possesses the dub/subs of any given show, it should be put on their site regardless of the country you're in. If they offered the show in Sanskrit, I'd insist it be available.

On top of all this, The Walking Dead which I recently started watching only offers subtitles in Spanish. What's that about? I'm watching it with English audio. Why are there no subtitles in English?

So many issues, Netflix. I shouldn't have to go pay for a VPN to have a marginal chance of accessing audio dubs and subs that I know you already possess in your library.

Any thoughts on why the house netflix account is slow and barely loads?,"So I've been trying to watch a show after an awful day, and it's been incredibly frustrating. 

Netflix Is unwatchable. You'd think the streaming service, who's only job by definition, would be capable of streaming. No. 

If I pause what I'm watching, usually that gives the show time to load and be able to play without interruption. But in this case, it's anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes of buffering before maybe getting to watch the show. And that's if the app doesn't crash. 

Browsing things to watch or finding something new to watch is just out of the picture. Opening the app, I have about 40 seconds to reach what I want to watch on my list, search a show/movie, or reach the continue watching spot before the app has a 15 second lag for each button press. 

So roommate 1 pays for Netflix. He has a round device that is probably 5, maybe more, years old. Roommate 2 has a round TV that we use the roku plug in on. As everything is already signed in. 

We have none of these problems on any of the other streaming services. 

We usually have good internet, but Netflix is consistently the only horrible one to use. 

About a year ago, roommate 1 (who pays for netflix) had their account hacked. And they said they changed their password and all the other stuff, but im fairly iffy on that part. 

So from this information, any idea what the issue could be? Old hardware that roku is phasing out by making unusable software?   I've got a few shows on Netflix I'd like to watch. But the app is horrendous and unusable as is. Hell, I paused my show to type this up, and one would think it would have had time to load fully but....

Are there any Netflix Games that you play and would recommend?,"I'm curious to see if there are.

I'd never really looked at the Netflix Games much, every time I flicked through the list it looked like a bunch of generic, rubbish mobile games. Then a couple of weeks ago I noticed [Into The Breach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaiFvuWsfy8).

Into The Breach is one of my favourite games of all time, I honestly think it's about as close to perfect as a game can get, and I always hoped that there would be a mobile version. Well now there is. It sucks that it's tied to Netflix and can't be bought as a standalone game, but it's still a great game on mobile regardless.

If you like strategy/puzzle games, I cannot recommend it enough.

Ragnarok s3 series ending...Is really interesting,"We saw Ragnarok at the graduation or the Ragnarok that was supposed to happen. A lot of things has been led that can lead us to a multiple endings like the it's just a dream ending and his stuck in an endless loop that he has now escaped.

Now here comes the Loop theory, Magne/Thor is destined to fight and die when Ragnarok comes. We know that Magne/Thor already fought and died in Ragnarok but lived again. What if it wasn't the first time it happened what if everytime Ragnarok happens they all start again at the begin. This explain Magne/Thor vision at the graduation, he saw the possible future of what would have happen if he didn't throw and move on.

Is there a setting for English Subtitles (not CC) for English-Language Programs?,"I've noticed more people requiring subtitles for streaming programs recently because of the inconsistency in volume between scenes/shots, as well as heavy accents, etc. (i.e. not that they are hard of hearing in other circumstances). While I rarely need them when I'm watching an English-language program, because many friends prefer them, I was considering popping them on to be the courteous host. 

That being said, I'm not a fan of ""closed captioning"" subtitles because I find the inclusion of speaker names, tone, and/or stage directions even more distracting (don't get me wrong, it's wonderful for people who are deaf/hard of hearing. However, I instinctively read first so I tend to find subtitles distracting regardless).

I've noticed programs like Seinfeld, while being English-language, offer subtitles without closed captioning, however, most only seem to list ""English (CC)"".

Am I missing something - either in the program settings or perhaps in my profile settings - or has Netflix never offered viewers a chance to watch with subtitles without all the additional text? I notice that there is only CC on Prime too.

I hate the way Dahmer’s portrayed in DAHMER,"Okay so I know im in no way qualified to talk about Evan Peters’ acting cause im not an actor screenwriter or anything..and I also know this series is more for showing the victim’s pov, right? But there are some pretty huge issues in the way he’s portrayed. And I dont even wanna sound like a jeffrey dahmer romanticizer or fan of any sorts, but these big differenced between how he acts in the show and how he is IRL is huge and really takes away from the whole thing. (Yes, i also know the show is dramaticized for entertainment purposes. But frankly, it wouldve been a lot more chilling and complex had they gone with the way it actually happened)

The biggest issue I have is that in the show, he acts like a dumb, naive, and almost childlike himbo that cant understand the gravity and evil of his own actions. He just looks and acts like such a child throughout the whole show and this misses the point of his real life persona where he was calm, cool, collected, charming, intelligent, well spoken, etc. But he doesnt sound too particularly bright in the show. He doesnt have the cold, methodical approach to him. Instead, he blows up and yells, which the real jeffrey dahmer would probably not do. 

Secondly this one doesnt matter THAT much, its just kind of there but annoys me whenever it becomes too prominent: His accent. Like others have also said, its way too heavy. IRL, he barely has no accent at all. And again, he sounds very eloquent. But in the show, he has a heavy wisconsin accent that is very unrealistic and half the time he slurs his words. Party hardy anyone? 

And thats basicslly it. Yeah, i know my opinion doesnt really matter. Like someone else said, though, its as though the creators tried to give him such different qualities to add to the whole “monster” name of the show and dehumanize him instead of realistically sticking to the horrific calmness and awareness to the real jeffrey dahmer, which is literally the thing that makes him do unique.

What documentaries should I watch?,"I've watched so many now and feel like I ran out. Kind of tired watching these big American documentaries about killers and justice so looking for new fresh material. I've seen Icarus and I liked the editing but it's too political for my likings.

Documentaries I've really liked:
- Untold Series
- Wild Wild Country
- My Octopus Teacher
- Virunga
- Our Planet Series
- Last Dance
- Seaspiracy
- Fantastic Fungi
- Kiss The Ground
- Chasing Coral
- Don't F**k With Cats

Depp v Heard: my review,"Ok, so first of all I didn't follow the trial at all when it was happening, so this is primarily a review of the documentary and not of which celebrity was lying / is an abuse victim. Watched it to get a bare bones overview of what the fuss was all about, in that at least it succeeded. 

Checked out the critical reviews after, and the biggest complaint among those who didn't like it seemed to be about the thing I appreciated most: that this is *a documentary without talking heads*. It would've been easy and expected for Emma Stone to call up a host of legal analysts, psychologists, etc to say authoritatively: ""This is who the real abuser was. This is what the whole thing says about society."" Whatever her opinion on the trial outcome was, she could've found people to make it sound like the only possible rational opinion, the voice of scientific expertise. I'm glad she didn't do that, because aside from bias, it would've been *boring*. I usually don't like documentaries for just this reason: they'll cut from a dramatic reenactment of an epic battle, to some boring professor at Oxford explaining it to us, and I find myself wishing they'd just made it into a fiction drama. Her approach felt both more immersive and more honest, it reminded me a bit of Svetlana Alexievich's approach to history writing where she collects diverse primary-source voices and curates them into a cohesive story rather than inserting herself as the lofty expert telling you what happened outright. 

That being said, I think she did have a bias: not just about which celebrity to believe, but towards legacy media and against new media. There was a laughable scene where she shows a CBS report telling us to be scared of election ""misinformation"" on TikTok, with its ""powerful and mysterious"" algorithm, as if this is somehow of a piece with ""misinformation"" on a he said/she said tabloid trial. And of course she got a lot of mileage out of the silly pro-Depp commenter in the Deadpool mask, and showing how the whole affair made TikTokers/YouTubers a lot of money, like it *didn't* make TV news broadcasters a lot of money. But again, because of the format of cutting from the trial itself to a diverse range of online commentators, no one view is allowed absolute primacy. Throughout the doc there are scenes of ""regular"" people addictively watching the drama on their cellphones, and at the very end, the camera cuts to a cellphone showing...the opening credits of ""Depp v Heard""! I had to laugh, since I had also been watching the damn thing on my phone.

Boston Bombing docuseries,"The horrid nature of all the atrocities committed set aside,

I never knew about how the FBI did not want the photos released to the public because they feared they would spook and accelerate their next attack. But it seemed like someone leaked it, possibly the cops. 

Then, if that guy didn’t escape from the car jacking, the brothers would have driven to New York and blown off the other bomb they used. So, thank god for that guy.

But instead of slow roll it (they had the SUV pinged), the cops engage and it ends up in a bloodbath, bullets flying through homes, and bombs in Watertown.

Netflix originals were never good.," 

People like to complain that Netflix originals have recently gotten bad but they've always been derivitive, terrible, or mid at best. We can go back to house of cards which just took West Wing and dumbed it down or orange is the new black which took the playbook Oz created almost a decade earlier and got rid of all the grit and edge that made it work. Then you get into the non fiction Marco Polo, Narcos, Dahmer etc. Of course those will have an appeal since it's just these people's lives and they had interesting lives but it's still just playing it incredibly safe there's very little risk involved in writing something that already happened and taking very few liberties with it. Finally, the anime remakes and franchise recreations. Netflix has no original IP's that anyone cares about to the level of say Batman or Pokemon so they're forced to take other properties and zombify them like Death Note or the Adams Family.

This all tyes into the fact that they can't come up with a single creative idea themselves. Everything is either extremly derivitive, someone else's IP they zombified, or someone's actual life.

idea for a possible series(hope an employee sees this when they browse the subreddit),"*So I'm redoing the idea a bit*

**------------------------------------------**

So this series would have the 50s futuristic aesthetic, like a mix of the look of the future in ""Meet The Robinsons""*(Movie)* and ""Astro Boy""s ""Metro City"", and [Fallout 4 pre war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F77Z25mObEk). the white family would consist of two 4 year old twin daughters, a single 13 year old son, and a mother and father in there 30s, And a robot nanny/butler which would be a hand-me-down from the mothers sister, whos in her late 20s, being more of a side character

Theres also a side characters being a more rich neighbor of a old white couple being in their 50s who hate the*(main)*family with the more normal day to day salary, mad they have it good, and mad they don't know life *""back then""*

**----------------------------------------------------**

*The personalities of the characters*

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

* **Twin Daughters**: These two twin daughters, named Eve and Lona have more of a typical child innocence, being curious, dumb, etc.
* **Teen Son**: named Jackson, hes more of a lazy, laid back person, always hanging out with his friends Gabriel*(Black)*, and Rebecca(*White)*.
* **Mother**: The mother being named Dacy*(day-see)*, is a sweet, kind mother but has a pretty low amount of patience and having the father fill in for her alot, which would be a joke in the series.
* **Father**:being named Arnold, he had mostly the same personality as the mother just having way more patience.
* **The Robot**: the robot, being simply named Paul is more similar to ""Fallout 4""s  ""MisterHandy"" / ""Codsworth"".

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

*Plot of an episode*

Its the summer of an alternate 2077 and the family decided to purchase the robot butler, all I got.

Wake Up Carlo- might be worth your time. I was pleasantly surprised,"For context, I like all sorts of cartoons. Standouts for me are Adventure Time, Inside Job, the shivering truth and flapjack- the last of which this show has a striking resemblance to

It's an odd one, that's for sure. I feel like maybe the cultural influences(this is a Brazilian cartoon with English sub/dub) can make some of the humor and jokes fall a tad flat at times, but some of the throwaway gags had me unexpectedly laughing as well. I'd give the humor a solid 8 out of 10, which is really good for a show I had no expectations of making me laugh going in 

What actually caught me off guard though is the emotional themes. This is very much a long form story, I'd even say like a really long movie moreso than a show, and the creators explore a lot of deeper themes of growing up and dealing with the insecurities and hardships that come with transitioning into adulthood. The main character, Carlo, fell asleep for 20+ years maintaining his own age while all his childhood friends grew up and forgot about him. The kid friendly/centric vibe of the show is most prominent in Carlo, but he's the perfect contrast for the rest of the cast when showing how they've changed compared to when they were his age.

Long story short, I won't pretend this show is a masterpiece, but it's hardly been mentioned since it came out and I feel like it may well deserve your attention if you're the kind of person that likes cartoons that explore more sentimental and emotional subjects.

Netflix Not Showing Certain Things over WiFi,"Hi All

Having some issues with Netflix over WiFi - I'm in the U.K. 

A lot of shows such as Friends and Shameless do not show over WiFi on PS4, Mobile, Tablet and Laptop. However, when i disconnect from WiFi and use my mobile data or 4G, these shows reappear.

Suits - Most and Least Favorite Characters?,"I know filmmaking is not easy, so I don't want to be hyper-critical, but I really don't like the Rachel character. I don't know if it's bad acting, bad directing, bad script writing, or some combination therein, but by Season 5 I found myself fast forwarding through all scenes that had the Rachel character in them. Eyes rolling up to start crying, eyes rolling down to force timid smiles, the over-emotional fake empathy, hearing ""I'm so sorry"" over and over again, and the go-nowhere wedding planning scenes - so tedious to watch, and the Rachel character just doesn't add anything to the overarching storyline for me.  


Interestingly, I have found the Lewis character to be one of the most compelling - he's a character I think we all love to hate, but I find myself rooting for him over and over... well, in between each of his screwups.

How terrible are the Ads in the cheapest plan?,"So, I've been tossing around the idea of getting a Netflix subscription, but the thing is, the prices give me a bit of sticker shock, especially when I consider the whole ads or no ads situation. What I'm really curious about is whether these ads are like clockwork, popping up roughly every 10 minutes, or if they're a bit more laid back, maybe just throwing in a couple of ads per episode. I'm really eager to tap into the wisdom of the crowd here and hear what you all think. Is this ad-based plan something that's kind of worth it, strikes a balance, or is it just a total ad-fest every 10 minutes that's driving everyone nuts? Or perhaps it's somewhere in between? Your take on dealing with ads in such a setup, whether they're frequent interruptions or more manageable, would be a huge help in guiding me toward a decision on whether diving into this ad-inclusive deal is a yay or a nay.

Edit: To anybody considering the plan with ads, I decided to give it a try, and I’m happy to say that it’s actually pretty good! If your anything like me and don’t really care about streaming in 4k, and want to save some money, this is definitely the plan for you. It seems to be about 2 minutes of ads for every 30 minutes of streaming as of August 2023.

Captain Fall: Inside Job's creatively bankrupt cousin.,"So guess how I spent my afternoon? Oh yeah, I just watched Netflix's newest adult animation series. And oh boy, do I have something to tell you!

... It was horrible... Every minute, EVERY SECOND! Of watching 10 WHOLE EPISODES OF THIS SH*T!Felt like some punishment I had to endure to repent for some horrible misdeed I did in some past life.

Let me give you a little context.

Captain Fall is about this worthless, hateable, dumbass main character that becomes an international crime syndicates patsy (fall guy) for their human trafficen business.

The 10 episodes basically revolves about the criminals trying to do their business while also making sure that captain Fall doesn't find out what they're doing and also try to become friends with him? I don't know what the show is trying to do with this messy ass plot... Oh and there's this Cop that gets bullied for trying to do his job, but nobody cares about him so we shouldn't neither.

The show reminds me a lot of Inside Job... if it was butchered in a cow-sh*t factory.

It takes a huge focus on the corrupt state of the world and the amount of horrendous things that can/might have actually happened. 

I'll give the show some due credit.
The scenes where the criminals commit... well, CRIMES! Are really engaging and I do think they were really onto something with the humor they laid out for those scenes... Except when they get overlapped by the 17th sex joke happening with each episode.

Speaking of sex, let's talk about the mistake in the room.

The main character, Captain Jonathan Fall or the poor man's version of of an unlikeable Brett.

I get what they were trying to do with this guy. Make his life so miserable and pathetic that people will feel bad about him. And if I'm being honest it does work to some extend... Until you hit a certain point in the series when you finally realize ""Holy sh*t, this guy DESERVES TO GET BULLIED!?""
The man's whole character is being sociale awkward while showing so many negative aspects of his personality, he's dumb, uncharming, gulliable, pathetic, and so on and so forth. The writers must have thought that with all those traits, the viewers must feel some sympathy for him... right?

NO! So what he had a sad childhood? The way the MC has been behaving throughout the entire has made me want to join in with his dumbass family to bully this man!

Oh right his dumbass family... Yeah they're a whole new level of crappy homelife, which was what they were written for, but that doesn't make them any less frustrating to watch.

The brother is basically a rich womanizing frat-bro who was ""better"" than his brother in every way, despite being shown as a total loser a few episodes in... I don't wanna tell you how exactly, so I'll just say ""sex joke.""

The mother and father are... Well rich adult cartoon parents. They don't care for anything except family recognizition, money and... sex.

The criminal character were okay, again they were the only good part of the show. But when the only good part of your show is just ""okay."" Then you really done messed up... Oh and the last scene they were in involves sex... You get what I'm saying.

This show is a dime-a-dozen amongst the other ""stellar"" and ""entertaining"" Adult Netflix Cartoons...

Netflix dublicated subtitles only in dolby vision bug?,"Hi!

Zombieverse thought,"I think the show has potential its a good theme, but sometimes its kinda ugh cuz of the cast are dumb athe only person who was actually usefull are kwangchu hyung and sometimes dex. 

Car scene: It was a good start but damn if you know they react to sound why keep on running and shouting i know that its scary and all but have some sense at least. 

Mall scene: Well they were all stupid. So the ones that I mention were good eneough. They were so stupid for letting out an injured person cuz they want everyone to have purpose which understandable but goddamn at least be logical about it. They could have just have 1 a look out since a mall have a intercom like what since they react to sounds they would follow the voice and roam freely or at least use the music that you discover they only use it when they were already munching the guy.

Park scene: broo I was this scene was so >:). Like brooooo the injured person was tracking the cars while some of them find the right one while this dumb fucker ( hong chol) literally sacrificed 2 people for his goddamn uselessness and he didn't do it this scene he also did it many times like fucker how the hell are you still alive. Bro even the injured one was usefull than him

Town scene: why are yall so carefree despite the situation at least be on guard or something of course it suspicious come on. And why the hell did you use a toy car without making sure the key is stable of course it will get kicked you can just even throw it on top of the cage but even though you could open her hoe would she get out. Yall could have done the circle thingy your in a factory their should be more thing there.

Carnival scene: this scene they all did great tbh they were all useful here they were good and even the employee sacrifice was smart he literally just let the half zombie out so that they could get out and the way they hong chol was not enough.

Add: the safe house scene was alright but the way the half zombie thinks that they were still normal is just sad for me but at the same time funny in a sarcastic way. They were like if we turn your gonna leave us? Goddamn right they should why would they not your putting them more in danger the purpose was to survive not to fucking turn everyone to zombies damn.

All in all it was alright still have potential hope for character developments. This is just my point of view please dont be shy to tell me your so that I could change my perspective.

Spacial Audio (w/ Airpods Pro) on LG C1 SmartTV,"**Hi all,**

I recently noticed that you can watch Netflix with **spacial audio**. Totally new to me but I LOVE it. I tested it out on my IPhone + Airpods Pro 2 and it's so epic! I feel much more immersed. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I have a big C1 LG TV in my living room that I would like to have the same audio experience with when watching Netflix movies. I've already tried to connect my Airpods to the TV, which works perfectly, however the spacial audio is not working.

I don't have the premium Netflix plan, so that probably reason #1. (""Netflix spatial audio is available on the Premium plan and enhances sound without the need for surround sound speakers or home theater equipment."")

1. But I was wondering, can I have spacial audio on my TV -> Airpods Pro 2 -> Netflix -> Premium plan - without the need for Apple TV? Or is spacial audio only possible if I buy an Apple TV? (if so, do I still need the premium plan or will apple tv be enough?)
2. Or will changing my netflix plan to premium be enough to experience spacial audio on my airpods pro 2 via my TV?

&#x200B;

Thanks a ton!

Take Care of Maya,"Wow, what a colossal failure. Say what you want about Beata but this was a case of medical personnel making the wrong decision initially about the mom/parent’s then doubling down on their decision. It’s obvious they were probably right about the ketamine dosage given to Maya but they were under the care of another medical doctor. Even if that doctor is a total quack or if mom made threats about getting Maya medical treatment, these folks were found guilty and the system never gave them a real chance at innocence.

There are many debatable topics including the ketamine regimen/coma and mom’s issues. But what needs to be the focus is the proximate cause. In this case, it’s a system that allows doctors and case workers to act as judges and juries in determining gulit. All those doctors involved in this should lose their license for such behavior and a few of these judges should be under investigation. This family was in no way harming their daughter. If they didn’t like the treatment plan, they should have gone after the other doctors. Our legal system needs to close the gap on these types of situations especially when for profit entities yield so much power. 

The other takeway from this is be weary of both the establishment and people with power. I’m not saying to go live in your basement or move to Alaska but I am saying some of the worst criminals are those you would least expect and hiding in plain sight.

Glamorous on Netflix - a review,"My partner and I watched the entire season of Glamorous recently, and I've been trying to find an outlet for my feelings about this show - most of which are *negative*.  This was a bad show.

However no one is talking about it, except to say ""It's shallow"" and ""Emily in Paris meets Devil Wears Prada"".  

With nowhere else to really talk about this, and my peer group really isn't a ""talking about TV"" type people, I come here, to a Netflix forum to air my opinions.  Hopefully I am in the right place, as I really need to dump this out of my head space and not have it occupy cycles any more.  I apologize in advance for this, but sometimes you just have to let it all out in order to move on.  

First and foremost, this show is *awful*.  Let's just get that out of the way.  I watch a lot of LGBTQ+ shows, and as a baby-gay, I grew up watching some truly awful content.  In modern times however, I expect a lot more, but sadly, this ain't it.  

Let's also get the lighting out of the way.  They do that New-Kirk Star Trek lighting where all the lights in every building are too bright and flare across the camera lens.  It looks like they work in a spaceship.  It is cold, distracting and awful.  

The acting isn't great, which is expected considering the actors have very little character to work with.  The plot is stupid, and the whole premise of the show appears to be ""Kim Cattrall is a gay icon, worship her"", meets ""maybe an uneducated ditz can fix all of our corporate negligence.""  

I really want to talk about the work environment and how it relates to the characters.  The work environment and the employees are *toxic*.  We have a.... leader?  Owner?  President?  who ignores her director of sales, who in turn is hiding sales numbers that screws up the company.  Which everyone is okay with, once that comes to light.  Don't hire people you intend to ignore.  We have this leader randomly hiring people for a failing company, with no defined roles aside from ""exist near me and fetch coffee"".  This of course means that our lead (Marco) manages to Do It All, from rescuing product samples, to suggesting campaigns, to ""challenging the paradigm"", to running a social media account (despite there being a literal social media person).  This is our ""Emily in Paris"" insert, without the gorgeous backdrop of France.  

But it gets worse than that.  When Assistant #1 tells her date (not yet girlfriend, because it is like date 1 or 2) that she is thinking about moving from a dying company as an assistant to some kind of Exec for a Massive, Stable Company, likely for mega-bucks, she is told in no uncertain terms that she is disloyal.  She should sacrifice herself for the dying company.  She should lash her body to the mast of a sinking ship because ""that's what is right"".  When she doesn't seem keen to toss her entire career into the trash, and is still considering whether to stick with the dead job or move to a high-paying dream job, she's called ""flightly"" and ""insecure"" and ""immature"".  She ""runs when the going gets tough"".  

This happens *numerous times*.  And each time she ultimately decides to sacrifice herself for the dying company.  Quietly, without recognition.  She is told directly that by ghosting the Big Stable Company that she has nuked her potential career options.  In the final moments of the season, she reveals that her actions caused The Company problems, and is fired.  She sacrifices herself in order to prove her loyalty.  Which, fortunately, is rewarded by her being re-hired in a better role.  But that was not her expectation.  She sacrificed herself for the company, knowing it could literally destroy her life financially (she would be civilly, if not criminally liable for her actions).  For The Company.  

Marco also plays this game a few times, where they go ""balls-to-the-wall"" for a company that has literally fired them (see: return of product samples).  

&#x200B;

Then there is the gatekeeping.  The son of Kim is a Gaybro Stereotype, and is the ignored Director of Sales.  And whenever he mentions anything LGBT-related, Marco rolls their eyes and even says things like ""Who taught you that?""  Because he is cis-gendered, white and muscly, he's not allowed to participate in LGBT culture.  Yes, he has more intrinsic privilege than people of colour in the same LGB circles, and yes he has more privilege than trans persons of any skin tone.  Absolutely.  But he's still part of the community.  Gatekeeping is toxic behaviour, full stop.  Minorities do not get ahead by stepping on other minorities.  Even if one segment of the minority group is ""less minority-ish"" than another segment.  It isn't an Oppression Competition.  

If we were to extrapolate this trend out, we'd be building an eye-roll pyramid.  White, masc gaybro says something, gets read by a white femme gayboy, who gets read by a POC homosexual (masc or femme? Who has the priority?), introduce a few lesbians/bisexuals in the mix of different skin tones in this pyramid somewhere, all of which can get read by a trans person (again, we do the shades of skin and sexuality), who could then be read by someone with a physical disability because *how dare they* with their non-disabled privilege, who can be read by....  I mean, c'mon.  Gatekeeping doesn't help.  It's toxic.  It divides, it doesn't unite.  This show chose not to ""be better"".  

Toxic also defines the mother-son dynamic.  Kim is a *terrible* mother to her son.  She actively ignores him.  Only when he tries to run screaming into the night without her does she finally offer him some degree of attention.  Some bribe to remain where he is.  Which he turns down, fortunately.  But she is *awful* to him.  

Now don't get me wrong - he's a shitty person too.  He is toxic AF.  He is a manipulative asshole who lies about the company's finances.  He wants to get someone fired because he isn't getting enough attention from mommy dearest.  He faces no repercussions for any of his actions, if anything he is rewarded for it by growing as a person.  A little.  He is not a good person and he is terrible to everyone around him, which is a pretty common theme in this show.  I won't white-knight for the white gaybro.  I think they even named him ""Chad"".  

&#x200B;

Legal - this drives me absolutely nuts.  There are so many legal problem with this show that makes me cringe.  Kim finds that her car has been bugged during business negotiations.  They do not call the cops.  They do not start an investigation.  They just roll with it.  Son basically cooks the books, at least internally, so that Kim has no idea that her company is spiraling out of control.  That's fine, we'll go with it.  They apparently have a fleet of lawyers, enough to hire on Marco's mother, on a different floor.  Reasons unknown.  Assistant #1 steals corporate secrets and hands them over to the annoying Contractor, who hands them over to the buying company, that immediately begins launching the exact same product.  *Everyone* here deserves a lawsuit, but Assistant #1 takes ownership and is (briefly) fired for it.  Then rewarded.  Why is their company failing again?  Oh yes, they are too stupid to run a business.  

And finally, tragically, our lead.  Marco.  I've avoided talking about Marco because I don't know how to refer to them.  This one is the most toxic character of all.  Gatekeeping galore.  Selfish.  Annoying.  Inflexible.  Marco basically stalks a boy to get a date out of him, and when the boy fucks up, runs.  Okay it wasn't a great look, the boy wasn't comfortable bringing Femme Marco out in public.  Not good, breakup warranted.  But there's a speech, a cameo from a drag queen and all is forgiven.  The Boyfriend is reinstated and makes changes.  Says it is a process, and starts to change.  

Of course BF turns out to be too good, so they introduce a toxic trait out of the blue, for which he apologies and tries to change that too.  It's a process, he recognizes his faults and he tries to do better.  We see no future evidence of this trait, so I'd say it's working.  

Until there is a work function.  BF wants to bring Marco to a work function, where everyone is expected to act and look a certain way.  It's the finance industry, which is brutal.  BF being able to bring a partner at all, is extremely progressive.  Even BF has to put on a show and act a certain way, his employability depends on it.  Marco agrees, then changes their mind and shows up in full Femme Glory.  ""100% acceptance without any transition period, full change on your part and zero flexibility on mine, or this relationship is over"".  Marco could have just refused to go to the event.  Instead dumped BF on the spot.  Again.  

What Marco does with the designer boy is also toxic.  There's just so much to unpack there, and this post is long enough.  Just know it's a big old package of toxic, selfish assholery.  

Then there is the finale.  The game-changer.  Through the entire series Marco is portrayed as a gay male who is femme.  He likes to wear makeup and non-masculine clothes.  The audience accepts that Marco has had his journey before the show started, and is comfortable in who he is.  Some boys like to wear makeup.  Some boys like to wear heels.  They are still boys.  It's acceptable.  This is called Gender Expression.  Cool, that's a core premise of the show.  

In the final moments, we discover Marco is off to talk to a Gender Transition Therapist, and has told their mother that Marco is actually a trans woman.  

Nowhere at all during the show was there any of this.  There was no discomfort with genders, no conversation about deadnames, no journey of discovery, no sense of not being the right body.  Nothing, nada.  Whatever journey Marco went on, it was done without the audience.  

This leaves us with a *terrible* takeaway - femme boys want to be women.  That's the message.  The boy that likes heels and makeup and 'femme' clothes is actually just trans.  With Marco's transition, we have *no* femme boys in the show.  The closest we have is a background-character drag queen that wears ""masc"" clothes when they interact with the non-LGBT world.  

And finally.  The piece that cannot be forgiven, they left the best possible joke (given the circumstances) on the table.  That is unforgivable.  The entire series they have a Guy With Sunglasses who doesn't say much, and they keep saying ""we don't know what this guy does here, but he does something"".  The best joke they could land in this awful show?  During the final ""we saved the day"" moment of the series, have him approach our central cast, lower his sunglasses and say ""You're welcome"", then walk away.  How did he help?  What did he fix?  That's the joke.  It's not award-winning humour, but it would give us half a heart-beat in this otherwise stinking corpse of a show.  

This show is toxic.  The plot is thin and dumb.  The acting is flat and lifeless, confusing sass with character.  The premise is dreadful.  The ideas of a work environment are anti-worker and pro-corporate.  The message for both trans folks and for femme guys is regressive.  This show had better not get a 2nd season, it was so bad, it beggars belief.  

&#x200B;

If you stuck with me this far, thanks.  I had to get this all out somewhere.  Hopefully having said my piece, this dreadful show can be purged from my memory.  If you haven't seen the show and were considering it, hopefully this opinion piece will convince you not to.

apologies and tries to change that too its a process he recognizes his faults and he tries to do better we see no future evidence of this trait so id say its working until there is a work function bf wants to bring marco to a work function where everyone is expected to act and look a certain way its the finance industry which is brutal bf being able to bring a partner at all is extremely progressive even bf has to put on a show and act a certain way his employability depends on it marco agrees then changes their mind and shows up in full femme glory acceptance without any transition period full change on your part and zero flexibility on mine or this relationship is over marco could have just refused to go to the event instead dumped bf on the spot again what marco does with the designer boy is also toxic theres just so much to unpack there and this post is long enough just know its a big old package of toxic selfish assholery then there is the finale the gamechanger through the entire series marco is portrayed as a gay male who is femme he likes to wear makeup and nonmasculine clothes the audience accepts that marco has had his journey before the show started and is comfortable in who he is some boys like to wear makeup some boys like to wear heels they are still boys its acceptable this is called gender expression cool thats a core premise of the show in the final moments we discover marco is off to talk to a gender transition therapist and has told their mother that marco is actually a trans woman nowhere at all during the show was there any of this there was no discomfort with genders no conversation about deadnames no journey of discovery no sense of not being the right body nothing nada whatever journey marco went on it was done without the audience this leaves us with a terrible takeaway femme boys want to be women thats the message the boy that likes heels and makeup and femme clothes is actually just trans with marcos transition we have no femme boys in the show the closest we have is a backgroundcharacter drag queen that wears masc clothes when they interact with the nonlgbt world and finally the piece that cannot be forgiven they left the best possible joke given the circumstances on the table that is unforgivable the entire series they have a guy with sunglasses who doesnt say much and they keep saying we dont know what this guy does here but he does something the best joke they could land in this awful show during the final we saved the day moment of the series have him approach our central cast lower his sunglasses and say youre welcome then walk away how did he help what did he fix thats the joke its not awardwinning humour but it would give us half a heartbeat in this otherwise stinking corpse of a show this show is toxic the plot is thin and dumb the acting is flat and lifeless confusing sass with character the premise is dreadful the ideas of a work environment are antiworker and procorporate the message for both trans folks and for femme guys is regressive this show had better not get a nd season it was so bad it beggars belief if you stuck with me this far thanks i had to get this all out somewhere hopefully having said my piece this dreadful show can be purged from my memory if you havent seen the show and were considering it hopefully this opinion piece will convince you not to thank you for coming to my tedtalk,glamorous on netflix a review,0
So can someone give me some actual insight?,"So of course I’m talking about the Witcher, truthfully it’s a decent show offers me enough intrigue to keep watching. It’s not my FAVORITE show or anything but it’s good enough to where I can look forward to the next season. 

Better than most Netflix shows, let’s just say that. 

But I’m seeing that people HATE this show and I just don’t get it? The changes from season to season are not that much different. The constant flicking between converging storylines is pretty typical when a show has several different focuses. 

The dialogue is progressive, there’s not that much change in the characters unless something happens to change them. The only thing I can rationalize is the diversion from the source material which isn’t that something people should want?

"Just finished the final season of Top Boy, and I've got some thoughts... (Spoilers of course)","This was by far the weakest season for me. It just felt rushed. Too many plot points weren't fully addressed.

* Aaron really left his little brother to grow up in a home and fend for himself, after they'd both just witnessed their big bro get killed by Sully. That just feels so wrong to me. Family was such a big thing for them, yet man really just decided to fuck off to Leeds without Stef...
* What happened to Stef's friend Tia? She was literally walking by when Sully killed Jamie, yet there was no mention of her in this season.
* We never even got to see a funeral for Jamie or any of the aftermath. 
* What was actually the point of bringing the Irish gangsters in? What did they actually do? They were introduced as this big bad force and were just offed in 2 episodes. Why not at least link them to Lizzie to give them some more relevance?
* What the fuck happened to Dushane's heart problems that they were building up over the last couple seasons? Literally nothing came of it.
* Dushane also just seemed so fucking stupid here. Why would this guy just leave Jeffrey's body where it was after killing him? He could've easily gotten the crew to help deal with it. Not like it's the first dead body they've had to deal with. Did bro just think that his DNA and fingerprints would magically disappear?
* Jaq stealing the drugs was such a dumb thing to do. why get Kierron involved as well?
* Sully shooting Dushane just felt weird to me man. Dushane has saved his life so many fucking times, yet no one ever brings that up when they're arguing. If anything, I would've preferred Dushane to die from a heart attack when they were talking with the wall between them.

My kid did something I can't figure out how to undo pls help,"My son, 4, had his own profile that I specifically went through and blacklisted certain shows I didn't want him to watch and was set to age appropriate content. The 3 other profiles are password protected so he can't get in them. But he figured out how to edit profiles... like change the names and pictures delete and add. He could do this on both his Amazon Fire and the PS4.

So. He treats adding and deleting profiles like a game. No matter how many times his dad and I tell him to NOT change profiles he continues do do it. He knows he isn't supposed to because whenever he creates a new one he will show you all coy like. Consequently I signed out of Netflix on his tablet and tried to limit his PS4 controller access. It had been a while since I signed him out on his tablet so I decided to give him another chance. Yada Yada Yada never trust a 4 year old now I have this problem.

He seems to have deleted his specifically curated kids profile. He added 2 new profiles and put something in Malaysian which I think I finally was able to put back in English. I have tried deleting the profiles on the app on the PS4 but after I press delete nothing happens... they are still there. I have used the website for full account controlls and when I go to delete there I am met with an error code. Why won't they delete??

Editing to add:
- The PS4 is my husband's not my son's. It is how the family watches TV in the living room

-My son doesn't have unlimited access to electronics all day but when he does have access to Netflix it was nice having a kids profile set for him to block garbage like Cocomelon and the like

-He has had more screen time this week specifically because I'm a SAHM and I also have a 1 year old and this week I have been ungodly sick with a sinus infection.  Normally we go to the library for story time once a week, go to the playground every day it isn't too hot, and I am teaching him prek lessons at home. The week I'm just trying to survive without my head exploding.

Why Netflix is bound to be a more successful streaming platform than individual company streaming platforms,"Despite companies opting to take their content off Netflix in favour of starting their own streaming platforms, most separate streaming companies that offer their own stuff fail to even turn a profit. Disney+ is the most notable example of this, as even with having the most successful entertainment IP’s in history they have yet to turn a profit on Disney+.

But why is this?

First and foremost, let’s follow the money.

In recent years, most of Disney’s newer entertainment projects have been duds or bombs. “Lightyear” just made its money back in terms of its production but lost hundreds of millions from marketing and failed merchandise. “Strange World” left the theatres as quickly and quietly as it entered. “The Little Mermaid” had some success but still lost out after marketing and promotional costs. And we can all guess where the new live-action Snow White is going…

But what has been making money?

“Top Gun: Maverick”, and the “Super Mario Bros. Movie”.

Each of these films quickly amassed over $1B USD globally the moment they came out into theatres. Even now, they’re still being watched and widely talked about, yet most other new movies made by other companies have been mostly forgotten.

So what’s the difference between these movies and Disney’s movies?

**Put simply, Top Gun: Maverick and Mario offered newer content that was high quality and even revolutionary.** What was done in Top Gun: Maverick had never been done before in cinematic history, and there’s never been an animated cinematic release of Mario. But most importantly, they took the time to make these films truly amazing and worth the ticket price.

**Meanwhile, Disney is failing to create truly new and high quality original content.** They keep releasing remakes and reboots that ultimately just rehash the elements of past successes without offering anything new, and they keep making them so fast that their quality has gone downhill.

**In other words, people want high quality content that’s never been done before.**

This is why Netflix is primed for success in the streaming platform wars.

Instead of amassing a whole bunch of franchises, they mostly allow numerous production companies to host their content on their platform. This allows them to constantly offer newer yet still high quality content on the regular, and switch out older or non-desirable content with new stuff.

This is a must in the streaming world as the convenience of streaming also means that consumers watch stuff faster and more regularly, yet their appetite is never fully satisfied.

On the other hand, companies like Disney+ and Paramount+ can only offer their own content, and because they’ve invested so much into their own franchises they can only offer content from those franchises. Yet as can easily be seen in recent box office performances, people have already gotten sick of content from those franchises.

This puts them between a rock and a hard place; they need to keep making more and newer stuff to keep up with streaming demands, yet they can’t make anything truly new because they’ve already invested so much into the franchises they’ve acquired.

**In conclusion, Netflix is destined to be the king of streaming for a long time. The demands for streaming services is for frequent, new, and high quality content, and they’re really only one of the few streaming services on the market that can meet that demand.**",7,0.7,3,fortifier22,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1694125133.0,False,False,False,2023-09-07 22:18:53,despite companies opting to take their content off netflix in favour of starting their own streaming platforms most separate streaming companies that offer their own stuff fail to even turn a profit disney is the most notable example of this as even with having the most successful entertainment ips in history they have yet to turn a profit on disney but why is this first and foremost lets follow the money in recent years most of disneys newer entertainment projects have been duds or bombs lightyear just made its money back in terms of its production but lost hundreds of millions from marketing and failed merchandise strange world left the theatres as quickly and quietly as it entered the little mermaid had some success but still lost out after marketing and promotional costs and we can all guess where the new liveaction snow white is going but what has been making money top gun maverick and the super mario bros movie each of these films quickly amassed over b usd globally the moment they came out into theatres even now theyre still being watched and widely talked about yet most other new movies made by other companies have been mostly forgotten so whats the difference between these movies and disneys movies put simply top gun maverick and mario offered newer content that was high quality and even revolutionary what was done in top gun maverick had never been done before in cinematic history and theres never been an animated cinematic release of mario but most importantly they took the time to make these films truly amazing and worth the ticket price meanwhile disney is failing to create truly new and high quality original content they keep releasing remakes and reboots that ultimately just rehash the elements of past successes without offering anything new and they keep making them so fast that their quality has gone downhill in other words people want high quality content thats never been done before this is why netflix is primed for success in the streaming platform wars instead of amassing a whole bunch of franchises they mostly allow numerous production companies to host their content on their platform this allows them to constantly offer newer yet still high quality content on the regular and switch out older or nondesirable content with new stuff this is a must in the streaming world as the convenience of streaming also means that consumers watch stuff faster and more regularly yet their appetite is never fully satisfied on the other hand companies like disney and paramount can only offer their own content and because theyve invested so much into their own franchises they can only offer content from those franchises yet as can easily be seen in recent box office performances people have already gotten sick of content from those franchises this puts them between a rock and a hard place they need to keep making more and newer stuff to keep up with streaming demands yet they cant make anything truly new because theyve already invested so much into the franchises theyve acquired in conclusion netflix is destined to be the king of streaming for a long time the demands for streaming services is for frequent new and high quality content and theyre really only one of the few streaming services on the market that can meet that demand,why netflix is bound to be a more successful streaming platform than individual company streaming platforms,0

Why are streaming shows much more downbeat and unhappy?,"This is very general I know that, and it actually has nothing to do with quality or IMO even freedom of expression (even though they indeed have more creative freedom, I think there is something more to what I am talking about than that). I get all the advantages that come with having more creative freedom and being able to swear/show more gore/nudity, etc but that's different from what I am actually saying I think, because you can have all these exact things but not necessarily have a dystopian and nihilistic TV show. In modern streaming shows there are usually not moments like in  X-Files, Twin Peaks, or Star Trek: Next Gen where something is given a sense of resolved semi-happy closure or ending to certain plotlines now and then?

The Lincoln Lawyer is one recent exception to this on Netflix. Of course, there are very serious and real, depressing moments/revelations, but it quickly moves on to another plotline where something else gets resolved more happily, or bittersweet maybe.

What I have noticed is shows that aren't on Network TV or Cable (for all their faults) are much more focused on just  constant nihilism and doom and gloom every step of the way, beating you down mentally with how much bad it can get ""You think that's depressing?  Hold my beer"". It's just a trend related to streaming I don't understand and doesn't make sense to me.

Like I said, my gripe has nothing to do with quality of any of these shows or anything like that, but basically shows on Streaming have a tendency to put me in a bad mood (even if they're better than what you see on both Network/Cable)? Yet I also appreciate seriousness and the sheer wight of a situation without comic relief, so I'm not looking for comedies either, but more of a neutral tone?

I basically wish there were more shows that had the quality of streaming but also aren't just completely depressing, or last had a change of pace and tone from this every now and then.

"As an international platform, Netflix increasingly necessitates a fully user-customizable recommendation algorithm that addresses language and demographics.",". . . because this current experience of the horrifically errant AI prediction requires that I expect all the intriguing European to not only not be acted in English, but to be dubbed too (which unfortunately turns an epic and award-deserving up-and-coming European production company into a great aesthetic with an excellent storyline completely wrecked by unauthentic voiceovers so obviously captured in an enclosed reviewing studio room.

but the TV app doesn't yet offer a fully customizable search operation or any identical default setting options.

One Piece Live Action thoughts,"So at this point save for Season 2 announcement due to the strikes, the LA has been a success. What I’ve noticed from fans in both this subreddit and big YouTubers, is that their main complaints is that is not 1:1 (think of Harry Potter when he fought the Dragon or Dumbledore speaking “calmly” in the goblet of fire). 

A majority of fans like it while the more unforgiving ones hate it due to not 1 to 1. However, it has been generally quite positive for completely blind viewers on this subreddit and general movie/tv show reviewers on YouTube, and that is a HUGE understated success. 

I think the biggest contrast to show my point is Grandlinereview’s criticisms and MrMorj’s criticism. If you want to see the point of view of a newcomer, try the channel Dan Murrel who bases his channel in movies reviews as well as box office analyses and has recently reviewed One Piece LA.

Honestly if we get more seasons and as long the newcomers like it, does critically well, and the adaption is equal to or better than the 1st season, then im going to treat the anime and manga fans like how I treat Harry Potter fans. Ignore and only listen to them if you want to know how it really went down in the source material, because for its medium, it’s excellent.

Choose love all possible endings,"UPDATE: Reddit sleuths have found more endings so I am listing all the actual ending scenes below (count is currently at 10, some with small variations) because maybe there are 16 of those? Comment if you find more!

* Gets engaged to Paul in LA right after talking to her boss and he gives her a battery and then does a magic trick with the ring (get there via scenario 1 below)
* Get married to Paul in Vegas in silly clothes with Rex as a witness and her sister and BIL on the phone (scenarios 2, 5 and 12). 
**Variations:** In scenario 2, the ring reveal (""That's the one from the escape room!"") happens here and the sister ends the scene with ""kidding!"" In both scenarios 5 and 12, Rex ends the scene with ""or is it?"" but in scenario 5, Paul still puts the ring on her finger during the ceremony; in scenario 12, she already has it on.
* Ends up alone playing slots with the psychic (scenario 3)
* Her and Jack ""choose"" each other but makes him agree the door to babies is open (scenario 4). 
**Variation:** She also tells him he's her dream come true if she asks for good news in the first scene of the movie
* Goes to Paris with Rex and they kiss on the balcony (scenario 6, 8, and 13, and 15)
* Tells Rex she's imagining someone else and tells Jack she never stopped loving him (scenario 7 and 9)
* Paul calls her at the protest and she goes back to LA. He thinks she's a burglar and is on the phone with 911 while he proposes (scenario 10 if she didn't tell Paul about Jack in the escape room)
* Paul calls her at the protest and proposes over the phone, she goes back to LA and they get engaged in the escape room (scenario 10 if she did tell Paul about Jack in the escape room)
* Paul calls her at the protest and Jack asks her if she wants to go after him and she asks how long it took him to get over her and he says ""I'll let you know"" and her and Jack decide to take it ""a day at a time"" (scenario 11)
* She tells Rex she wants to be his producer and not date and leaves the door open for at least 2 romantic relationships (sometimes she's fully rejected Paul, sometimes she just didn't call him) (scenarios 14 and 16)


All the articles I can find describe 6 endings but I saw more than that. Scott Michael Foster said there are 16. I guess maybe it depends on how you define ""ending."" I've identified 9 final scenes (3 with Paul, 3 with Jack, 2 with Rex and one alone) with 16 ways to get there (5 to Paul, 4 to Jack, 4 to Rex, and 3 ""other""), so I think I found them all?

8. Picks Jack in dream, and goes with Rex when he offers the gig; doesn't return Paul's call; ends up in Paris with Rex.

An open letter about the success of one piece live action,"&#x200B;

An open letter from just another unknown consumer, but important for the pockets of the great audiovisual producers in the American industry.

Producers and studio CEOs, learn from the success of The Last of Us and One Piece. Really involve the original authors in the works, if they were successful enough to reach your ears, it's because of these people. They had something to communicate with the world through their works and that resonated in the hearts of thousands of people.

The age of full rights agreements, and giving responsibility to directors and producers who don't even read the source material, instead delegating it to an assistant to tell them how the original work is, and after that they ignore everything and go do another ""Marvel-style"" adaptation, it's over! if you insist on this you will only continue to lose money, and leave many frustrated fans.

Why are new fantasy shows so dark (low light)?,"I'm watching ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" at the moment and I have trouble seeing what's going on because a lot of the scenes set at night are so dark that the contrast of my TV can't keep up.

I'm down to a point where I can only watch shows like that in the evening after the sunset to properly enjoy them, which is kind of annoying since I work shifts. 
Why do producers do that? I get that they want to set a mood but what's the point if you can't see the scene properly?

(Before everybody comments I should check my TV settings: The contrast option already is at 50/50 and adjusting the brightness doesn't really help. The sun isn't shining directly through the window and I don't have trouble watching anything else from other genres like comedy.

Last night in Soho - Netflix what's with these horrible filters!!,"Another film using terrible filters to simulate it being shot in the 60's

It looks nothing like film from the sixties.

It's a 4k stream, which should look sharp and crisp.

But instead, we get this checkerboard pattern over every thing

Even the Title screen, and text is all square checkerboard.

Certain shots emphasize this, look at the Coca cola can, in one shot.  It's terrible pixelated, does not resemble anything, from film, from the 60's

Look at the edges of things, faces, arms, anything with a straight line, is transformed into a Blocky checkered board edge.

Blurred images in the background, just look like a low-resolution mess.

Of course the plot line to Paul is the easiest. So, I went back and made a decision to choose Rex. Got Rex in Paris. Now getting Cami to choose Jack was where it got interesting! Not only did the show keep putting obstacles and opportunities in her way to make it nearly impossible... But when I finally did get to the final option to choose the ending with him, it presented what I think you are calling the Easter egg. It gives Cami the option to be alone! Then the tarot reappears and you see Cami about to win a slot machine!
...What's hilarious is that Jack is the one choice you can choose where Paul walks right across the screen and says, ""Really? Because he's so good looking?"" and challenges you to make a better decision ""next time"". I think it's because he is the past, and you already walked away from each other before. Cami is moving forward in her career, one that will no doubt require interactions with people like sleezy hotel owners and questionable pop stars. What's amazing is the show doesn't pass any judgement or hint at the possibility of a tryst with Rex being an impulsive fling. It just lets you decide that's where you are right now...
I know most of the options seem unimportant to the plot line, but I found what was enjoyable about this kind of entertainment was that it let me keep Cami a likable relatable character, sort of. I wasn't mentally sabotaging her the first time around because I made the decisions I felt good about... Unlike, say Carrie Bradshaw, who is so frequently unlikable that you sort of root for her to crash and burn. 

Anyway, I was surprised there was so little content to read about this show... And in case you couldn't find your way around Paul, maybe consider what that means about how you choose...

Any thoughts on why the house netflix account is slow and barely loads?,"So I've been trying to watch a show after an awful day, and it's been incredibly frustrating. 

Netflix Is unwatchable. You'd think the streaming service, who's only job by definition, would be capable of streaming. No. 

If I pause what I'm watching, usually that gives the show time to load and be able to play without interruption. But in this case, it's anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes of buffering before maybe getting to watch the show. And that's if the app doesn't crash. 

Browsing things to watch or finding something new to watch is just out of the picture. Opening the app, I have about 40 seconds to reach what I want to watch on my list, search a show/movie, or reach the continue watching spot before the app has a 15 second lag for each button press. 

So roommate 1 pays for Netflix. He has a round device that is probably 5, maybe more, years old. Roommate 2 has a round TV that we use the roku plug in on. As everything is already signed in. 

We have none of these problems on any of the other streaming services. 

We usually have good internet, but Netflix is consistently the only horrible one to use. 

About a year ago, roommate 1 (who pays for netflix) had their account hacked. And they said they changed their password and all the other stuff, but im fairly iffy on that part. 

So from this information, any idea what the issue could be? Old hardware that roku is phasing out by making unusable software?   I've got a few shows on Netflix I'd like to watch. But the app is horrendous and unusable as is. Hell, I paused my show to type this up, and one would think it would have had time to load fully but....

Captions are going 15 seconds after loading. But no video or audio has loaded. Rewinding...

Are there any Netflix Games that you play and would recommend?,"I'm curious to see if there are.

I'd never really looked at the Netflix Games much, every time I flicked through the list it looked like a bunch of generic, rubbish mobile games. Then a couple of weeks ago I noticed [Into The Breach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaiFvuWsfy8).

Into The Breach is one of my favourite games of all time, I honestly think it's about as close to perfect as a game can get, and I always hoped that there would be a mobile version. Well now there is. It sucks that it's tied to Netflix and can't be bought as a standalone game, but it's still a great game on mobile regardless.

If you like strategy/puzzle games, I cannot recommend it enough. Incredibly simple to pick up and learn the basics, but with so much depth as you learn more about it, and the game translates to a phone screen really well. Controls are spot on and it's the full game, so you're not missing out on a single feature compared to the PC version.

What documentaries should I watch?,"I've watched so many now and feel like I ran out.

Documentaries I've really liked:
- Untold Series
- Wild Wild Country
- My Octopus Teacher
- Virunga
- Our Planet Series
- Last Dance
- Seaspiracy
- Fantastic Fungi
- Kiss The Ground
- Chasing Coral
- Don't F**k With Cats

It gives a Cyperpunk Vibe just in „Real Life“ -
has a lot of good slomos, Vfx and some good messages about „ endless living“ and the death in general. I love the character design. I didn’t finish it yet but i already love it.
I never heard of it before so i hope more people will notice it.

Netflix originals were never good.," 

People like to complain that Netflix originals have recently gotten bad but they've always been derivitive, terrible, or mid at best. We can go back to house of cards which just took West Wing and dumbed it down or orange is the new black which took the playbook Oz created almost a decade earlier and got rid of all the grit and edge that made it work. Then you get into the non fiction Marco Polo, Narcos, Dahmer etc. Of course those will have an appeal since it's just these people's lives and they had interesting lives but it's still just playing it incredibly safe there's very little risk involved in writing something that already happened and taking very few liberties with it. Finally, the anime remakes and franchise recreations. Netflix has no original IP's that anyone cares about to the level of say Batman or Pokemon so they're forced to take other properties and zombify them like Death Note or the Adams Family.

This all tyes into the fact that they can't come up with a single creative idea themselves. Everything is either extremly derivitive, someone else's IP they zombified, or someone's actual life.

idea for a possible series(hope an employee sees this when they browse the subreddit),"*So I'm redoing the idea a bit*

**------------------------------------------**

So this series would have the 50s futuristic aesthetic, like a mix of the look of the future in ""Meet The Robinsons""*(Movie)* and ""Astro Boy""s ""Metro City"", and [Fallout 4 pre war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F77Z25mObEk). the white family would consist of two 4 year old twin daughters, a single 13 year old son, and a mother and father in there 30s, And a robot nanny/butler which would be a hand-me-down from the mothers sister, whos in her late 20s, being more of a side character

Theres also a side characters being a more rich neighbor of a old white couple being in their 50s who hate the*(main)*family with the more normal day to day salary, mad they have it good, and mad they don't know life *""back then""*

**----------------------------------------------------**

*The personalities of the characters*

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

* **Twin Daughters**: These two twin daughters, named Eve and Lona have more of a typical child innocence, being curious, dumb, etc.
* **Teen Son**: named Jackson, hes more of a lazy, laid back person, always hanging out with his friends Gabriel*(Black)*, and Rebecca(*White)*.
* **Mother**: The mother being named Dacy*(day-see)*, is a sweet, kind mother but has a pretty low amount of patience and having the father fill in for her alot, which would be a joke in the series.
* **Father**:being named Arnold, he had mostly the same personality as the mother just having way more patience.
* **The Robot**: the robot, being simply named Paul is more similar to ""Fallout 4""s  ""MisterHandy"" / ""Codsworth"".

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

*Plot of an episode*

Boston Bombing docuseries,"The horrid nature of all the atrocities committed set aside,

I never knew about how the FBI did not want the photos released to the public because they feared they would spook and accelerate their next attack. But it seemed like someone leaked it, possibly the cops. 

Then, if that guy didn’t escape from the car jacking, the brothers would have driven to New York and blown off the other bomb they used. So, thank god for that guy.

But instead of slow roll it (they had the SUV pinged), the cops engage and it ends up in a bloodbath, bullets flying through homes, and bombs in Watertown.

They call in every possible law enforcement t agency into Watertown to search door to door. Guns drawn at doors. Zero probable cause, but I get the tension. 

They are checking trash cans on the street for the guy. They shut the whole city down for a day. 

When they get a report of a person in the boat 2 days after, WHICH WAS ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM THE SHOOTOUT, the cops come and have a shootout for no reason instead of slow rolling it, using arial surveillance, setting a perimeter, and waiting for the right tactical equipment, and the FBI.

Wake Up Carlo- might be worth your time. I was pleasantly surprised,"For context, I like all sorts of cartoons. Standouts for me are Adventure Time, Inside Job, the shivering truth and flapjack- the last of which this show has a striking resemblance to

It's an odd one, that's for sure. I feel like maybe the cultural influences(this is a Brazilian cartoon with English sub/dub) can make some of the humor and jokes fall a tad flat at times, but some of the throwaway gags had me unexpectedly laughing as well. I'd give the humor a solid 8 out of 10, which is really good for a show I had no expectations of making me laugh going in 

What actually caught me off guard though is the emotional themes. This is very much a long form story, I'd even say like a really long movie moreso than a show, and the creators explore a lot of deeper themes of growing up and dealing with the insecurities and hardships that come with transitioning into adulthood. The main character, Carlo, fell asleep for 20+ years maintaining his own age while all his childhood friends grew up and forgot about him. The kid friendly/centric vibe of the show is most prominent in Carlo, but he's the perfect contrast for the rest of the cast when showing how they've changed compared to when they were his age.

Long story short, I won't pretend this show is a masterpiece, but it's hardly been mentioned since it came out and I feel like it may well deserve your attention if you're the kind of person that likes cartoons that explore more sentimental and emotional subjects. If you're like me and got teary eyed in the ""together again"" Adventure Time special, then I definitely recommend you give it a watch",3,0.72,0,Jet_Jirohai,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1692332037.0,False,False,False,2023-08-18 04:13:57,for context i like all sorts of cartoons standouts for me are adventure time inside job the shivering truth and flapjack the last of which this show has a striking resemblance to its an odd one thats for sure i feel like maybe the cultural influencesthis is a brazilian cartoon with english subdub can make some of the humor and jokes fall a tad flat at times but some of the throwaway gags had me unexpectedly laughing as well id give the humor a solid out of which is really good for a show i had no expectations of making me laugh going in what actually caught me off guard though is the emotional themes this is very much a long form story id even say like a really long movie moreso than a show and the creators explore a lot of deeper themes of growing up and dealing with the insecurities and hardships that come with transitioning into adulthood the main character carlo fell asleep for years maintaining his own age while all his childhood friends grew up and forgot about him the kid friendlycentric vibe of the show is most prominent in carlo but hes the perfect contrast for the rest of the cast when showing how theyve changed compared to when they were his age long story short i wont pretend this show is a masterpiece but its hardly been mentioned since it came out and i feel like it may well deserve your attention if youre the kind of person that likes cartoons that explore more sentimental and emotional subjects if youre like me and got teary eyed in the together again adventure time special then i definitely recommend you give it a watch,wake up carlo might be worth your time i was pleasantly surprised,0

Suits - Most and Least Favorite Characters?,"I know filmmaking is not easy, so I don't want to be hyper-critical, but I really don't like the Rachel character. I don't know if it's bad acting, bad directing, bad script writing, or some combination therein, but by Season 5 I found myself fast forwarding through all scenes that had the Rachel character in them. Eyes rolling up to start crying, eyes rolling down to force timid smiles, the over-emotional fake empathy, hearing ""I'm so sorry"" over and over again, and the go-nowhere wedding planning scenes - so tedious to watch, and the Rachel character just doesn't add anything to the overarching storyline for me.  


Interestingly, I have found the Lewis character to be one of the most compelling - he's a character I think we all love to hate, but I find myself rooting for him over and over... well, in between each of his screwups.

NAILED IT Baking Challenge loses all the Nailed It Charm,"I was so SO disappointed at this ""something different"" take for Nailed It.  It loses all the reasons why Nailed It separated itself from the rest of the monotonous baking show and then became, throughout the episodes, another monotonous baking show.

It focused WAY too much on the guest chefs and whichever contestant was most over the top and NOT ENOUGH Nicole and Jaque.  They are the heart and soul (along with Wes) and they're like background who cares hosts.

Also you can tell the show didn't know what it wanted to be. The first episode was somewhat like Nailed it but then the longer it went, the more competent the people were becoming but the Guest Hosts (Oswalt) and Nichole and Jaque laughing at the result feels more mean when they had 3 1/2 hours to bake compared to the hour 45 they had (which is going to be a hot mess).

Untold: Johnny Manziel - Too Soft,"I was really looking forward to watching this but about halfway through it started feeling like someone at the production company was Johnnys best friend.

He set Cleveland back another 4 years and also fucked up his specialists careers by wasting years and hurting stats. All because he just didn’t feel like trying. Fuck him.

How terrible are the Ads in the cheapest plan?,"So, I've been tossing around the idea of getting a Netflix subscription, but the thing is, the prices give me a bit of sticker shock, especially when I consider the whole ads or no ads situation. What I'm really curious about is whether these ads are like clockwork, popping up roughly every 10 minutes, or if they're a bit more laid back, maybe just throwing in a couple of ads per episode. I'm really eager to tap into the wisdom of the crowd here and hear what you all think. Is this ad-based plan something that's kind of worth it, strikes a balance, or is it just a total ad-fest every 10 minutes that's driving everyone nuts? Or perhaps it's somewhere in between? Your take on dealing with ads in such a setup, whether they're frequent interruptions or more manageable, would be a huge help in guiding me toward a decision on whether diving into this ad-inclusive deal is a yay or a nay.

Edit: To anybody considering the plan with ads, I decided to give it a try, and I’m happy to say that it’s actually pretty good! If your anything like me and don’t really care about streaming in 4k, and want to save some money, this is definitely the plan for you. It seems to be about 2 minutes of ads for every 30 minutes of streaming as of August 2023.

Zombieverse thought,"I think the show has potential its a good theme, but sometimes its kinda ugh cuz of the cast are dumb athe only person who was actually usefull are kwangchu hyung and sometimes dex. 

Car scene: It was a good start but damn if you know they react to sound why keep on running and shouting i know that its scary and all but have some sense at least. 

Mall scene: Well they were all stupid. So the ones that I mention were good eneough. They were so stupid for letting out an injured person cuz they want everyone to have purpose which understandable but goddamn at least be logical about it. They could have just have 1 a look out since a mall have a intercom like what since they react to sounds they would follow the voice and roam freely or at least use the music that you discover they only use it when they were already munching the guy.

Park scene: broo I was this scene was so >:). Like brooooo the injured person was tracking the cars while some of them find the right one while this dumb fucker ( hong chol) literally sacrificed 2 people for his goddamn uselessness and he didn't do it this scene he also did it many times like fucker how the hell are you still alive.

Town scene: why are yall so carefree despite the situation at least be on guard or something of course it suspicious come on. And why the hell did you use a toy car without making sure the key is stable of course it will get kicked you can just even throw it on top of the cage but even though you could open her hoe would she get out. Yall could have done the circle thingy your in a factory their should be more thing there.

Carnival scene: this scene they all did great tbh they were all useful here they were good and even the employee sacrifice was smart he literally just let the half zombie out so that they could get out and the way they hong chol was not enough.

Add: the safe house scene was alright but the way the half zombie thinks that they were still normal is just sad for me but at the same time funny in a sarcastic way. They were like if we turn your gonna leave us? Goddamn right they should why would they not your putting them more in danger the purpose was to survive not to fucking turn everyone to zombies damn.

I just watched the 1st episode of the new Nailed It! season with my partner. We have grown very fond of Nicole and Jacques and the chemistry they've had on the show.

Now this season changed the formula a bit and over the course of the whole 40+min episode, both Nicole & Jacques were on the screen for about 10mins only?
Heck, even the guest star was announced around 15mins into the episode and he basically showed up for the last few minutes?

While me and my partner absolutely love the show, we're both kind of reluctant to continue watching it. 
It honestly doesn't feel the same with main presenters screen time being so extremely shortened.

Take Care of Maya,"Wow, what a colossal failure. Say what you want about Beata but this was a case of medical personnel making the wrong decision initially about the mom/parent’s then doubling down on their decision. It’s obvious they were probably right about the ketamine dosage given to Maya but they were under the care of another medical doctor. Even if that doctor is a total quack or if mom made threats about getting Maya medical treatment, these folks were found guilty and the system never gave them a real chance at innocence.

There are many debatable topics including the ketamine regimen/coma and mom’s issues. But what needs to be the focus is the proximate cause. In this case, it’s a system that allows doctors and case workers to act as judges and juries in determining gulit. All those doctors involved in this should lose their license for such behavior and a few of these judges should be under investigation. This family was in no way harming their daughter. If they didn’t like the treatment plan, they should have gone after the other doctors. Our legal system needs to close the gap on these types of situations especially when for profit entities yield so much power. 

The other takeway from this is be weary of both the establishment and people with power. I’m not saying to go live in your basement or move to Alaska but I am saying some of the worst criminals are those you would least expect and hiding in plain sight.

So can someone give me some actual insight?,"So of course I’m talking about the Witcher, truthfully it’s a decent show offers me enough intrigue to keep watching. It’s not my FAVORITE show or anything but it’s good enough to where I can look forward to the next season.

But I’m seeing that people HATE this show and I just don’t get it? The changes from season to season are not that much different. The constant flicking between converging storylines is pretty typical when a show has several different focuses. 

The dialogue is progressive, there’s not that much change in the characters unless something happens to change them. The only thing I can rationalize is the diversion from the source material which isn’t that something people should want?

Netflix dublicated subtitles only in dolby vision bug?,"Hi!

I have a Lg A1 oled Tv.

My tv was working fine before but I did a factory reset to free upp some space and make the tv a bit quicker. I used same settings as before the factory reset.

I noticed in netflix only with dolby vision that the subtitles was really blurry. If i look close the subtitles are dublicated on top of each other. If i try to change around with the subtitles settings in the netflix app the subtitles shows correct first in the preview but then act up wierd and some as a white block/bar.

Anyone know how I fix this? I have tried to delete and reinstall netflix but same problem with subtitles. Also tried to do the factory reset again.
The problem seems to be with the netflix app. Before the reset I had no problems with the subtitles in dolby vision.

Captain Fall: Inside Job's creatively bankrupt cousin.,"So guess how I spent my afternoon? Oh yeah, I just watched Netflix's newest adult animation series. And oh boy, do I have something to tell you!

... It was horrible... Every minute, EVERY SECOND! Of watching 10 WHOLE EPISODES OF THIS SH*T!Felt like some punishment I had to endure to repent for some horrible misdeed I did in some past life.

Let me give you a little context.

Captain Fall is about this worthless, hateable, dumbass main character that becomes an international crime syndicates patsy (fall guy) for their human trafficen business.

The 10 episodes basically revolves about the criminals trying to do their business while also making sure that captain Fall doesn't find out what they're doing and also try to become friends with him? I don't know what the show is trying to do with this messy ass plot... Oh and there's this Cop that gets bullied for trying to do his job, but nobody cares about him so we shouldn't neither.

The show reminds me a lot of Inside Job... if it was butchered in a cow-sh*t factory.

It takes a huge focus on the corrupt state of the world and the amount of horrendous things that can/might have actually happened. 

I'll give the show some due credit.
The scenes where the criminals commit... well, CRIMES! Are really engaging and I do think they were really onto something with the humor they laid out for those scenes... Except when they get overlapped by the 17th sex joke happening with each episode.

Speaking of sex, let's talk about the mistake in the room.

The main character, Captain Jonathan Fall or the poor man's version of of an unlikeable Brett.

I get what they were trying to do with this guy. Make his life so miserable and pathetic that people will feel bad about him. And if I'm being honest it does work to some extend... Until you hit a certain point in the series when you finally realize ""Holy sh*t, this guy DESERVES TO GET BULLIED!?""
The man's whole character is being sociale awkward while showing so many negative aspects of his personality, he's dumb, uncharming, gulliable, pathetic, and so on and so forth. The writers must have thought that with all those traits, the viewers must feel some sympathy for him... right?

NO! So what he had a sad childhood? The way the MC has been behaving throughout the entire has made me want to join in with his dumbass family to bully this man!

Oh right his dumbass family... Yeah they're a whole new level of crappy homelife, which was what they were written for, but that doesn't make them any less frustrating to watch.

The brother is basically a rich womanizing frat-bro who was ""better"" than his brother in every way, despite being shown as a total loser a few episodes in... I don't wanna tell you how exactly, so I'll just say ""sex joke.""

The mother and father are... Well rich adult cartoon parents. They don't care for anything except family recognizition, money and... sex.

The criminal character were okay, again they were the only good part of the show. But when the only good part of your show is just ""okay."" Then you really done messed up... Oh and the last scene they were in involves sex... You get what I'm saying.

Glamorous on Netflix - a review,"My partner and I watched the entire season of Glamorous recently, and I've been trying to find an outlet for my feelings about this show - most of which are *negative*.  This was a bad show.

However no one is talking about it, except to say ""It's shallow"" and ""Emily in Paris meets Devil Wears Prada"".  

With nowhere else to really talk about this, and my peer group really isn't a ""talking about TV"" type people, I come here, to a Netflix forum to air my opinions.  Hopefully I am in the right place, as I really need to dump this out of my head space and not have it occupy cycles any more.  I apologize in advance for this, but sometimes you just have to let it all out in order to move on.  

First and foremost, this show is *awful*.  Let's just get that out of the way.  I watch a lot of LGBTQ+ shows, and as a baby-gay, I grew up watching some truly awful content.  In modern times however, I expect a lot more, but sadly, this ain't it.  

Let's also get the lighting out of the way.  They do that New-Kirk Star Trek lighting where all the lights in every building are too bright and flare across the camera lens.  It looks like they work in a spaceship.  It is cold, distracting and awful.  

The acting isn't great, which is expected considering the actors have very little character to work with.  The plot is stupid, and the whole premise of the show appears to be ""Kim Cattrall is a gay icon, worship her"", meets ""maybe an uneducated ditz can fix all of our corporate negligence.""  

I really want to talk about the work environment and how it relates to the characters.  The work environment and the employees are *toxic*.  We have a.... leader?  Owner?  President?  who ignores her director of sales, who in turn is hiding sales numbers that screws up the company.  Which everyone is okay with, once that comes to light.  Don't hire people you intend to ignore.  We have this leader randomly hiring people for a failing company, with no defined roles aside from ""exist near me and fetch coffee"".  This of course means that our lead (Marco) manages to Do It All, from rescuing product samples, to suggesting campaigns, to ""challenging the paradigm"", to running a social media account (despite there being a literal social media person).  This is our ""Emily in Paris"" insert, without the gorgeous backdrop of France.  

But it gets worse than that.  When Assistant #1 tells her date (not yet girlfriend, because it is like date 1 or 2) that she is thinking about moving from a dying company as an assistant to some kind of Exec for a Massive, Stable Company, likely for mega-bucks, she is told in no uncertain terms that she is disloyal.  She should sacrifice herself for the dying company.  She should lash her body to the mast of a sinking ship because ""that's what is right"".  When she doesn't seem keen to toss her entire career into the trash, and is still considering whether to stick with the dead job or move to a high-paying dream job, she's called ""flightly"" and ""insecure"" and ""immature"".  She ""runs when the going gets tough"".  

This happens *numerous times*.  And each time she ultimately decides to sacrifice herself for the dying company.  Quietly, without recognition.  She is told directly that by ghosting the Big Stable Company that she has nuked her potential career options.  In the final moments of the season, she reveals that her actions caused The Company problems, and is fired.  She sacrifices herself in order to prove her loyalty.  Which, fortunately, is rewarded by her being re-hired in a better role.  But that was not her expectation.  She sacrificed herself for the company, knowing it could literally destroy her life financially (she would be civilly, if not criminally liable for her actions).  For The Company.  

Marco also plays this game a few times, where they go ""balls-to-the-wall"" for a company that has literally fired them (see: return of product samples).  

&#x200B;

Then there is the gatekeeping.  The son of Kim is a Gaybro Stereotype, and is the ignored Director of Sales.  And whenever he mentions anything LGBT-related, Marco rolls their eyes and even says things like ""Who taught you that?""  Because he is cis-gendered, white and muscly, he's not allowed to participate in LGBT culture.  Yes, he has more intrinsic privilege than people of colour in the same LGB circles, and yes he has more privilege than trans persons of any skin tone.  Absolutely.  But he's still part of the community.  Gatekeeping is toxic behaviour, full stop.  Minorities do not get ahead by stepping on other minorities.  Even if one segment of the minority group is ""less minority-ish"" than another segment.  It isn't an Oppression Competition.  

If we were to extrapolate this trend out, we'd be building an eye-roll pyramid.  White, masc gaybro says something, gets read by a white femme gayboy, who gets read by a POC homosexual (masc or femme? Who has the priority?), introduce a few lesbians/bisexuals in the mix of different skin tones in this pyramid somewhere, all of which can get read by a trans person (again, we do the shades of skin and sexuality), who could then be read by someone with a physical disability because *how dare they* with their non-disabled privilege, who can be read by....  I mean, c'mon.  Gatekeeping doesn't help.  It's toxic.  It divides, it doesn't unite.  This show chose not to ""be better"".  

Toxic also defines the mother-son dynamic.  Kim is a *terrible* mother to her son.  She actively ignores him.  Only when he tries to run screaming into the night without her does she finally offer him some degree of attention.  Some bribe to remain where he is.  Which he turns down, fortunately.  But she is *awful* to him.  

Now don't get me wrong - he's a shitty person too.  He is toxic AF.  He is a manipulative asshole who lies about the company's finances.  He wants to get someone fired because he isn't getting enough attention from mommy dearest.  He faces no repercussions for any of his actions, if anything he is rewarded for it by growing as a person.  A little.  He is not a good person and he is terrible to everyone around him, which is a pretty common theme in this show.  I won't white-knight for the white gaybro.  I think they even named him ""Chad"".  

&#x200B;

Legal - this drives me absolutely nuts.  There are so many legal problem with this show that makes me cringe.  Kim finds that her car has been bugged during business negotiations.  They do not call the cops.  They do not start an investigation.  They just roll with it.  Son basically cooks the books, at least internally, so that Kim has no idea that her company is spiraling out of control.  That's fine, we'll go with it.  They apparently have a fleet of lawyers, enough to hire on Marco's mother, on a different floor.  Reasons unknown.  Assistant #1 steals corporate secrets and hands them over to the annoying Contractor, who hands them over to the buying company, that immediately begins launching the exact same product.  *Everyone* here deserves a lawsuit, but Assistant #1 takes ownership and is (briefly) fired for it.  Then rewarded.  Why is their company failing again?  Oh yes, they are too stupid to run a business.  

And finally, tragically, our lead.  Marco.  I've avoided talking about Marco because I don't know how to refer to them.  This one is the most toxic character of all.  Gatekeeping galore.  Selfish.  Annoying.  Inflexible.  Marco basically stalks a boy to get a date out of him, and when the boy fucks up, runs.  Okay it wasn't a great look, the boy wasn't comfortable bringing Femme Marco out in public.  Not good, breakup warranted.  But there's a speech, a cameo from a drag queen and all is forgiven.  The Boyfriend is reinstated and makes changes.  Says it is a process, and starts to change.  

Of course BF turns out to be too good, so they introduce a toxic trait out of the blue, for which he apologies and tries to change that too.  It's a process, he recognizes his faults and he tries to do better.  We see no future evidence of this trait, so I'd say it's working.  

Until there is a work function.  BF wants to bring Marco to a work function, where everyone is expected to act and look a certain way.  It's the finance industry, which is brutal.  BF being able to bring a partner at all, is extremely progressive.  Even BF has to put on a show and act a certain way, his employability depends on it.  Marco agrees, then changes their mind and shows up in full Femme Glory.  ""100% acceptance without any transition period, full change on your part and zero flexibility on mine, or this relationship is over"".  Marco could have just refused to go to the event.  Instead dumped BF on the spot.  Again.  

What Marco does with the designer boy is also toxic.  There's just so much to unpack there, and this post is long enough.  Just know it's a big old package of toxic, selfish assholery.  

Then there is the finale.  The game-changer.  Through the entire series Marco is portrayed as a gay male who is femme.  He likes to wear makeup and non-masculine clothes.  The audience accepts that Marco has had his journey before the show started, and is comfortable in who he is.  Some boys like to wear makeup.  Some boys like to wear heels.  They are still boys.  It's acceptable.  This is called Gender Expression.  Cool, that's a core premise of the show.  

In the final moments, we discover Marco is off to talk to a Gender Transition Therapist, and has told their mother that Marco is actually a trans woman.  

Nowhere at all during the show was there any of this.  There was no discomfort with genders, no conversation about deadnames, no journey of discovery, no sense of not being the right body.  Nothing, nada.  Whatever journey Marco went on, it was done without the audience.  

This leaves us with a *terrible* takeaway - femme boys want to be women.  That's the message.  The boy that likes heels and makeup and 'femme' clothes is actually just trans.  With Marco's transition, we have *no* femme boys in the show.  The closest we have is a background-character drag queen that wears ""masc"" clothes when they interact with the non-LGBT world.  

And finally.  The piece that cannot be forgiven, they left the best possible joke (given the circumstances) on the table.  That is unforgivable.  The entire series they have a Guy With Sunglasses who doesn't say much, and they keep saying ""we don't know what this guy does here, but he does something"".  The best joke they could land in this awful show?  During the final ""we saved the day"" moment of the series, have him approach our central cast, lower his sunglasses and say ""You're welcome"", then walk away.  How did he help?  What did he fix?  That's the joke.  It's not award-winning humour, but it would give us half a heart-beat in this otherwise stinking corpse of a show.  

This show is toxic.  The plot is thin and dumb.  The acting is flat and lifeless, confusing sass with character.  The premise is dreadful.  The ideas of a work environment are anti-worker and pro-corporate.  The message for both trans folks and for femme guys is regressive.  This show had better not get a 2nd season, it was so bad, it beggars belief.  

&#x200B;

If you stuck with me this far, thanks.  I had to get this all out somewhere.  Hopefully having said my piece, this dreadful show can be purged from my memory.  If you haven't seen the show and were considering it, hopefully this opinion piece will convince you not to.

with nowhere else to really talk about this and my peer group really isnt a talking about tv type people i come here to a netflix forum to air my opinions hopefully i am in the right place as i really need to dump this out of my head space and not have it occupy cycles any more i apologize in advance for this but sometimes you just have to let it all out in order to move on first and foremost this show is awful lets just get that out of the way i watch a lot of lgbtq shows and as a babygay i grew up watching some truly awful content in modern times however i expect a lot more but sadly this aint it lets also get the lighting out of the way they do that newkirk star trek lighting where all the lights in every building are too bright and flare across the camera lens it looks like they work in a spaceship it is cold distracting and awful the acting isnt great which is expected considering the actors have very little character to work with the plot is stupid and the whole premise of the show appears to be kim cattrall is a gay icon worship her meets maybe an uneducated ditz can fix all of our corporate negligence i really want to talk about the work environment and how it relates to the characters the work environment and the employees are toxic we have a leader owner president who ignores her director of sales who in turn is hiding sales numbers that screws up the company which everyone is okay with once that comes to light dont hire people you intend to ignore we have this leader randomly hiring people for a failing company with no defined roles aside from exist near me and fetch coffee this of course means that our lead marco manages to do it all from rescuing product samples to suggesting campaigns to challenging the paradigm to running a social media account despite there being a literal social media person this is our emily in paris insert without the gorgeous backdrop of france but it gets worse than that when assistant tells her date not yet girlfriend because it is like date or that she is thinking about moving from a dying company as an assistant to some kind of exec for a massive stable company likely for megabucks she is told in no uncertain terms that she is disloyal she should sacrifice herself for the dying company she should lash her body to the mast of a sinking ship because thats what is right when she doesnt seem keen to toss her entire career into the trash and is still considering whether to stick with the dead job or move to a highpaying dream job shes called flightly and insecure and immature she runs when the going gets tough this happens numerous times and each time she ultimately decides to sacrifice herself for the dying company quietly without recognition she is told directly that by ghosting the big stable company that she has nuked her potential career options in the final moments of the season she reveals that her actions caused the company problems and is fired she sacrifices herself in order to prove her loyalty which fortunately is rewarded by her being rehired in a better role but that was not her expectation she sacrificed herself for the company knowing it could literally destroy her life financially she would be civilly if not criminally liable for her actions for the company marco also plays this game a few times where they go ballstothewall for a company that has literally fired them see return of product samples then there is the gatekeeping the son of kim is a gaybro stereotype and is the ignored director of sales and whenever he mentions anything lgbtrelated marco rolls their eyes and even says things like who taught you that because he is cisgendered white and muscly hes not allowed to participate in lgbt culture yes he has more intrinsic privilege than people of colour in the same lgb circles and yes he has more privilege than trans persons of any skin tone absolutely but hes still part of the community gatekeeping is toxic behaviour full stop minorities do not get ahead by stepping on other minorities even if one segment of the minority group is less minorityish than another segment it isnt an oppression competition if we were to extrapolate this trend out wed be building an eyeroll pyramid white masc gaybro says something gets read by a white femme gayboy who gets read by a poc homosexual masc or femme who has the priority introduce a few lesbiansbisexuals in the mix of different skin tones in this pyramid somewhere all of which can get read by a trans person again we do the shades of skin and sexuality who could then be read by someone with a physical disability because how dare they with their nondisabled privilege who can be read by i mean cmon gatekeeping doesnt help its toxic it divides it doesnt unite this show chose not to be better toxic also defines the motherson dynamic kim is a terrible mother to her son she actively ignores him only when he tries to run screaming into the night without her does she finally offer him some degree of attention some bribe to remain where he is which he turns down fortunately but she is awful to him now dont get me wrong hes a shitty person too he is toxic af he is a manipulative asshole who lies about the companys finances he wants to get someone fired because he isnt getting enough attention from mommy dearest he faces no repercussions for any of his actions if anything he is rewarded for it by growing as a person a little he is not a good person and he is terrible to everyone around him which is a pretty common theme in this show i wont whiteknight for the white gaybro i think they even named him chad legal this drives me absolutely nuts there are so many legal problem with this show that makes me cringe kim finds that her car has been bugged during business negotiations they do not call the cops they do not start an investigation they just roll with it son basically cooks the books at least internally so that kim has no idea that her company is spiraling out of control thats fine well go with it they apparently have a fleet of lawyers enough to hire on marcos mother on a different floor reasons unknown assistant steals corporate secrets and hands them over to the annoying contractor who hands them over to the buying company that immediately begins launching the exact same product everyone here deserves a lawsuit but assistant takes ownership and is briefly fired for it then rewarded why is their company failing again oh yes they are too stupid to run a business and finally tragically our lead marco ive avoided talking about marco because i dont know how to refer to them this one is the most toxic character of all gatekeeping galore selfish annoying inflexible marco basically stalks a boy to get a date out of him and when the boy fucks up runs okay it wasnt a great look the boy wasnt comfortable bringing femme marco out in public not good breakup warranted but theres a speech a cameo from a drag queen and all is forgiven the boyfriend is reinstated and makes changes says it is a process and starts to change of course bf turns out to be too good so they introduce a toxic trait out of the blue for which he apologies and tries to change that too its a process he recognizes his faults and he tries to do better we see no future evidence of this trait so id say its working until there is a work function bf wants to bring marco to a work function where everyone is expected to act and look a certain way its the finance industry which is brutal bf being able to bring a partner at all is extremely progressive even bf has to put on a show and act a certain way his employability depends on it marco agrees then changes their mind and shows up in full femme glory acceptance without any transition period full change on your part and zero flexibility on mine or this relationship is over marco could have just refused to go to the event instead dumped bf on the spot again what marco does with the designer boy is also toxic theres just so much to unpack there and this post is long enough just know its a big old package of toxic selfish assholery then there is the finale the gamechanger through the entire series marco is portrayed as a gay male who is femme he likes to wear makeup and nonmasculine clothes the audience accepts that marco has had his journey before the show started and is comfortable in who he is some boys like to wear makeup some boys like to wear heels they are still boys its acceptable this is called gender expression cool thats a core premise of the show in the final moments we discover marco is off to talk to a gender transition therapist and has told their mother that marco is actually a trans woman nowhere at all during the show was there any of this there was no discomfort with genders no conversation about deadnames no journey of discovery no sense of not being the right body nothing nada whatever journey marco went on it was done without the audience this leaves us with a terrible takeaway femme boys want to be women thats the message the boy that likes heels and makeup and femme clothes is actually just trans with marcos transition we have no femme boys in the show the closest we have is a backgroundcharacter drag queen that wears masc clothes when they interact with the nonlgbt world and finally the piece that cannot be forgiven they left the best possible joke given the circumstances on the table that is unforgivable the entire series they have a guy with sunglasses who doesnt say much and they keep saying we dont know what this guy does here but he does something the best joke they could land in this awful show during the final we saved the day moment of the series have him approach our central cast lower his sunglasses and say youre welcome then walk away how did he help what did he fix thats the joke its not awardwinning humour but it would give us half a heartbeat in this otherwise stinking corpse of a show this show is toxic the plot is thin and dumb the acting is flat and lifeless confusing sass with character the premise is dreadful the ideas of a work environment are antiworker and procorporate the message for both trans folks and for femme guys is regressive this show had better not get a nd season it was so bad it beggars belief if you stuck with me this far thanks i had to get this all out somewhere hopefully having said my piece this dreadful show can be purged from my memory if you havent seen the show and were considering it hopefully this opinion piece will convince you not to thank you for coming to my tedtalk,glamorous on netflix a review,0

{potential spoilers} The Witcher was a forgettable tale..,"which isn't saying much as i do believe it started off quite strong as an action-adventure, darker fantasy show..

My problem with the show is seeing this formerly content character end up being trapped by fate into this huge dramatic THING that he probably would have been better able to prevent otherwise.. It takes him away from doing his job full-time and there are some inconsistencies with his character because of what kind of person he now has to be...  I think people would have enjoyed less of a looming terror forcing Geralt and Ciri into ""politics"" and more of them doing some actual monster fighting/figuring out Ciri's curse/gift,,  and just left the more political stuff to the mages. it wasnt a bad show but there are so many moments that make it difficult to re-experience as you might feel like you are waiting forever to get anywhere in the story...

I think they had a perfect start for a show but as time went on could have done better on all fronts...  It seemed like there were some needlessly long parts of the story that just wound up confusing some people instead of informing them..

U7121-1331 occurs when connected to external display,"I've been pulling my hair out with this issue. The Netflix support page says that it's because whatever plan I'm using only allows me to watch Netflix on mobile and tablet. That's not true given that I can use Netflix fine on a Fire Stick and on my laptop when the display is disconnected.

If I play a video on my laptop, and then connect the screen, everything is fine. But then the second the episode ends and Netflix loads the next one, the same issue occurs. I've replicated it on separate displays and with different cables, including HDMI and DisplayPort. Weirdly, the issue doesn't occur on Chrome or Edge, but the resolution is capped to 720p on both, despite the fact that Edge should allow 4k playback. Initially Edge had the same issue, but reinstalling HEVC codes made Edge play at 720p.

The monitor itself is a 32"" 1440p VA panel, which allows 4k input. I can confirm that I'm subscribed to the Premium Ultra HD plan so it's not a billing issue either. Netflix support has been next to useless, telling me that Netflix has never had the functionality to play on external displays, but given that I could play movies on a monitor just fine, I'm assuming this is a server-side issue? Plus the fact that PCs that don't come with an inbuilt display probably use Netflix as well. 

I factory reset my laptop a while back and I thought maybe that's causing the issue, which is why I reinstalled/updated my graphics drivers and re-installed video codecs. Has anyone faced this issue before?

Did anybody remember this Netflix original?,"There was this show called Pibby: Dark Ages, It's about a former cartoon animator named Amanda Smith, She created this in-universe education show called Learning With Pibby, It was (somehow) attacked by The Darkness which got the show cancelled, Amanda Smith decided to join the Arizona Paranormal Control which they were trying to contain APC-2357 also called The Happy Virus

&#x200B;

I don't know how the glitchy blob got 2 official names but there was this evil cult called ""The Hackers Of The Unseen"" which they hated media and have world domination if all media was erased, They created The Darkness or APC-2357, to attack Pibby

&#x200B;

I remember it being released in August 2018 when the short premiered on YouTube in March 3, 2018 and the April fools stunt started in April 1, 2018

&#x200B;

I think in the season finale, Melissa and Meta-Kid got corrupted when Pibby is fighting The Darkness, Season 2 or Pibby: New Recruits has Pibby befriending 2 new allies, An adult galactic female and a adult male cop and in the season and series finale, they got corrupted which also makes the whole human population disappear

&#x200B;

The main villian of Season 1 and Season 2 is Donna, A black adult woman who has the ability to corrupt other media characters, She is part of The Darkness disguised as a woman, The Darkness seems to be shapeshift into any form to catch the media characters

The said season and series finale post credits scene shows Donna losing his Darkness abilities and is no longer a disguise of The Darkness and roams around the empty city of Arizona and it kind of tributes the Pibby fans for proving the show

"How do movies make profits when offered as part of a streaming service? Every time you watch a specific film, does money automatically go to the makers?","I was tempted to watch d Pinball: The Man Who Saved the Game through links provided by a Pinball Discord rooms linking to piracy sites. But I love Pinball so much that I ultimately decided to subscribe to Hulu so I can watch the movie since it has no official release on DVD or Blu Ray so far and I was already given a Hulu gift card I haven't touched back in December.

But I do wonder if I helped support the film makers? Because I loved the movie so much that I'm willing to create an account on Vudu or some other place to purchase the movie to send my support to the studios and publishers if me watching it didn't help bring them profit. In fact I'm gonna be watching the movie all the time while I have Hulu and Hulu's other offerings have seriously made me consider staying on the service if I can continuously watch The Man Who Saved rhe Game multiple times over and over. So long as this movie remains and I know the makers of the movie have made money until a physical disc released is offically made.

So how do movies offered as a package on a service make cash? Every time you watch it does royalties get sent out to the distributor and studio even if its form the same account over and over? Or does royalty only get sent once per account viewing it for the first time? Or do distributors and the film studio make profits through a different way?

Really love the movie so I ask because I want to continue supporting the studio! How does profits work for a movie on a service?

(spoiler alert!) My Dad the Bounty Hunter: critique,"The creators of this show deserve some real credit.  

   It starts out perfectly with the (slightly forgettable) chase scene that gets me excited for an action based show; then cuts to the normal life of the current MC's (very cool wish i had a dad that cool xD).  In great timing the show gets started for reals with the kids sneaking aboard the spaceship and they are able to visit a good amount of unique and interesting places. This is what really got me excited for more.  

  I figured that at the time when Lisa had decided to ally with Vax that it would have been a sort of character arc for her which instead wound up being short lived which was disappointing tbh..  But there is only so much you can do in a weekend (im assuming) i guess.. like one of those adventures where at some point the characters split for whatever reason and we get to follow multiple adventures.   Lisa could have learned from Vax how to fight government corruption and Sean and Terry would continue hunting them while doing other jobs FOR said government.. I get it isnt the best choice to promote the idea of kids running away to join strange crews but they basically already did it so idk i just thought it would have been better to really commit to..    

This is one thing but it is actually a huge flaw with newer shows today..  as one choice ultimately cuts an adventure way short and doesnt give people as much time as they wanted to really grow with the characters....

"Is this a tiny Error in ""How to Become a Cut Leader"" and am i being nitpicky? (No content spoilers)","This might be incredibly minor, but in the scene E1 starting 8:45, the speaker clearly speaks of the ""karmic wheel"". The Subtitles go:

\*He studies the teachings of Buddha,

the gospel of born-again Christians,

Hinduism's karmic wheel.\*

Now im not religious myself but i know that [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) is a very different concept from [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma) . The symbol shown in the scene (analog to the Buddha and the Cross before) is - to the best of my knowledge - called the [Dharmachakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmachakra) .

Do You Think Netflix Executives are Anti-Christianity?,"I've been holding off on posting this, but I keep seeing unapologetically blasphemous scenes in Netflix-produced content lately. It seems like every new show I've seen lately contains language or scenes that mock Jesus or contain related curses in ways that would never make it past censors on other streamers or most other studios for wide release. I understand that they've also had at least one show centered around Jesus that triggered widespread outrage.

One example: Yesterday, there was a scene with someone getting assaulted with a Bible in an empty church by a corrupt Army leader in a Netflix-branded Korean show. The scene had no reason whatsoever to be in a church. If I remember correctly, there were also issues along these lines with cursing in the church in BEEF. Would the leadership have allowed this with the religious texts or houses of worship of any other major religion? Nope - they wouldn't dare risk the Salman Rushdie treatment.

Netflix 4K bitrate seems quite inconsistent,"Has anything changed recently?

&#x200B;

I'm watching Dark (Season 2) and I noticed some artifacts so I pressed the info button and noticed it was streaming at 1.4Mbps! That's the lowest I've ever seen for a 4K show.

&#x200B;

I tried on my TV upstairs (closer to main router) and it was at 4Mbps (still much lower than I would have expected).

A speed test on both TVs consistently gets over 100Mbps and I've never had any issues before with streams being above 15Mbps.

&#x200B;

Just tried Our Planet II and it is around 8Mbps which again seems on the low side.

Do other countries have weird availability of seasons of certain shows?,"Okay, so I live in Belgium and thus have the Belgian availability in shows on Netflix and I have been noticing this weird trend over the last year.

Xbox X netflix app failing to open / Major audio + video glitch,"See photo captions. 

Netflix app hasn’t updated since 7/12 and *has* been used successfully since update.

The Pale Blue Eye,"Holy fuck man, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.

This movie had a pretty neat concept, at least for someone who is quite the Poe fan. Admittedly I haven't read the book the movie is based on, so I can't vouch for the movies adherence to the source material. I'm giving credit where it's due, the cinematography and acting is really good. However this movie really, really fell off towards the end.

1: The movie feels incredibly long.

I'm no movie reviewer, but the pacing kind of feels off. Sitting through the movie felt like a chore, and was overall a slog. I'm happy I didn't watch it in theatres, as it gave me the freedom to get up and get a drink, at least. 
Imagine if the movie was as slow as сталкер (Stalker), but with none of the fulfillment.

2: The ending is unsatisfying.

In the first half, upon the reveal of Le Clerc's rare novels, I joked to my friend that we were suddenly watching Indiana Jones. The fact that they brought up the family reveal later is a bit of a Checkov's gun, and wasn't a big gripe.
The real problem stems from the fact that after the family is revealed to be devil worshippers, and the villains meet their demise, the movie still isn't over.
The ""true"" ending revealing our main character as the bad guy, the r**e of his daughter, and the whole vengeance plot felt really uninspired and unnecessary. Even though the Satanist villains were unsatisfying, the additional ending made me actively upset. It didn't need to be in the movie, and made it a worse experience.

Is Netflix tracking our email?,"Something really weird and seemingly shady happened and I wonder if anyone has seen something similar, or has any insight.

The messed up thing is that she does NOT have Netflix on her phone.  She never has.  She has never installed it or signed in.  She DID use her phone when she originally set up her account, got emails on it regarding signing up etc.

How to check a content availability on streaming platforms ?,"Hi,

Sorry if my question isn't on the right subreddit but turns out r/streaming is about YT/Twitch streaming...

I wanna build our BluRay collection around films we can't find on the streaming platforms, to reduce redundancy.

Is there a way to easily check if a movie is available on the platforms we are subscribed to and which one ?

Medium subtitles kinda small and Large subtitles insanely huge?,"Hey all. Just got an android stick for an old smart TV with outdated software. One of the things i was looking for is being able to change Netflix subtitle settings, since the TV software wouldn't allow that and always had a fixed Medium sub size (which we think is kinda small).

&nbsp;

Now, we have to keep using this Medium size, since the next one (Large) is just massive.

&nbsp;

Like, couldn't there be a intermediary size in between Medium and this very Large one?

&nbsp;

Also tried changing subtitle settings via the profile on PC but its just ends up with the same sizes as in the android tv Netflix subtitle menu.

&nbsp;

Does anyone know of any way (maybe a third party app?) that would allow messing with Netflix subtitles settings? (would need to work on an android TV too)

Is the Large size also huge on you guys systems aswell?

Ooku: The Inner Chambers viewers I want to talk to you,"I searched r/netflix and was unable to locate any discussion regarding this animated series.  If you're watching it, please tell me your POV. 

It's new to me.  I haven't read the books or seen the movie.  Some background: so the show is an alternate history set in the Edo period in Japan where the male population has been seriously reduced due to a virus, and women are the leaders.  This creates new dynamics amongst the remaining male population which is possibly hinted at in the title.  I love sci-fi and animation, this show fits into the rarely produced ""Gender reversal/Parallel historical drama"" niche. Voice talent is good.  I'm on episode 4 and plan on seeing it to the end.  I'd like to know where this strangely seductive storyline takes me.  

I'm also encouraged by how many awards it's won.  Wiki says  ""*Ōoku: The Inner Chambers* won an Excellence Prize at the 10th [Japan Media Arts Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Media_Arts_Festival), a special prize at The Japanese Association of Feminist Science Fiction and Fantasy's fifth annual [Sense of Gender Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_Gender_Awards) in 2005, and the Grand Prize of the 13th [Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezuka_Osamu_Cultural_Prize) in 2009. ""

So, I can't be the only person surprised that this little slice of Japanese Bizarro World is on Netflix.  I'm rooting for Arikoto, fascinated by the setting, and impressed by the animation style.

RED ROSE (2022) Just finished - I have questions!,"Good evening! :)

I just finished watching 'Red Rose' (2022) and overall, I really did love it! It's completely up my street, with the technology aspect, thriller, mystery etc, with a touch of the paranormal creepiness. However, having just finished it, I have questions, that I'm hoping people might be able to answer, or just see if I'm the only one with these opinions.

Also, I know the soundtrack has mixed opinions, but for the record, I really enjoyed it.  Putting a slower spin on 90s classics made them so chilling and eerie, which was perfect for the scenes they were used in imo.  Especially >!'Barbie Girl' - the slower speed forces you to really pay attention to the lyrics, and its use at Rochelle's funeral, sent chills up my spine with the disturbing context.  Genius move from the creators!!< 

I'm going to spoiler-hide the majority of this, just incase!

\---- The >!""ghosts"" on the phone, such as Rochelle's mother, Rochelle herself. Are we supposed to assume these are created digitally and superimposed onto the receiver's phone? I'm presuming so, although I'm not tech minded enough to know if such a thing is even possible. It just really bummed me out that they never explained that properly, when in the beginning, it was such a ""WTF"" factor. !<

\--- Wren's dad getting >!arrested. WHAT THE HELL. No, really, why didn't they just leave? Ok, her Dad had a busted leg, but they could have hobbled out the building and then called an ambulance or something? If there's no record for Red Rose having kidnapped Rick, there is no record of Wren having killed ... whoever the hell he was in the end.!<

And even if the police >!did rock up, and arrest him, there are enough witnesses to the overall crime, to be able to corroborate a self defence. Plus, Rick has been stabbed in the leg. Clearly it's self defence. He could have said he killed the guy to protect his daughter. Again, it just bugs me that we watch the poor sod being carted off, and not one person tries to fight for him. It's not poetic... it just seemed dumb.!<

\--- Speaking of the police... can we assume that the >!people watching Red Rose online likely called them, the moment Red Rose was deleted? If so, the police may be able to track those calls, which gives evidence to the real goings-on.  Potentially not though, if the observers of Red Rose are good at covering their tracks. But then, why would they even bother calling the police?  Strikes me that a group of people who find murdering teenagers funny, wouldn't really start crying about the potential death of one of their own. Or I dunno, maybe they would....but I can't imagine they'd help one of their own, at the risk of being discovered themselves.!<

\---- Jaya.... jaya, you're awesome, but for the love of God, >!WHY ARE YOU NOT USING A VPN? C'mon girl, that is beyond a rookie error.!<

\---- It just pissed me off in general that, even though we now know >!that Rochelle was murdered, and Wren has literally seen the video of it happening, that we're just... not going to report that to the cops and try and get someone interested in it.  It's not the 1970s anymore. The police know about the dark web and cyber crime. Even if Jaya deleted Red Rose, who is to say that the police, or highers, couldn't use the computer Jaya was using to observe Red Rose, and see if there is any trace of it as evidence.  Does this mean that her Dad and the twins will live their whole lives thinking she killed herself, with no justice?  I really hope not.!<

\---- The random woman who was >!The Gardener. She was very... panto villain. I don't hate her as a character, but she was just too random. I'd have loved it slightly more if she had been randomly used in background scenes.. that you will only clock her properly and go ""OMG she was there all the time!""!<

\---- Small bugbear but I REALLY wanted Patrick to >!be more involved. He was forever floating around in scenes, small interactions, but he was never utilised. As much as I like Jaya, I really wanted him to be the one meeting the group in Manchester. He says he loved Rochelle, and you saw how gutted he was at the funeral. After Wren's outburst, I wanted him to have done some digging of his own, and turns out he's not the waste of space everyone may have taken him for.!<

\---- Was the newsagent guy (where Taz tries to buy cider) the same >!medical dude that Taz sees in the hospital. before clocking that Ashley had been kidnapped from her ward? EDIT: Actually I just looked back and I don't think he is.!<

But sidenote: the >!medical dude - are we to assume he is a genuine medical professional, or just sneaked in as one? He definitely can get past the staff door sooo...!<

Honestly, if so, that is one of the most terrifying things - maybe of the entire series. For the series to acknowledge that here is a >!medical professional, someone in a position of ABSOLUTE trust, meant to save lives and look after people, and on the quiet, he's casually encouraging and enjoying the murder of teenagers. Of course, it's not without precedent - i.e. Harold Shipman. But still. Damn. That is a chilling edition to the show, albeit one that only lasts a matter of seconds.!<

Don't get me wrong, overall, I LOVED the series. It had way more amazing points, than bad, imo (it takes a lot to hook me so much that I binge a series that quick. Less than 48 hours in this case!) :)

Would I like a second series? Well it clearly is set up for that to potentially happen. But as someone in a different thread pointed out, the whole driving factor of this series, was keeping guessing who or what Red Rose actually was. Now we know, >!that mystery is gone. They would have to do something pretty clever and new with it, using Red Rose as the supporting concept, in order to capture the same audience again. It'd be interesting to see though. I'm not against it, I'm just not sure how you'd easily go about doing that. Either way, I do like the actual ending, that Red Rose has been brought back again, and my geeky heart enjoys that it resurfaces in Japan of all places, which has an amazing name in the world of horror movies.!<",1,0.6,0,tropicalazure,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1689533682.0,False,False,False,2023-07-16 18:54:42,good evening i just finished watching red rose and overall i really

Only PCM audio works perfectly. Auto audio on LG TV causes Surround Sound to cut out from time to time. Can’t find a solution anywhere. Other LV apps have perfect surround sound.,"I can’t find anything on Reddit or the internet to help solve this odd issue. 

I’m currently unable to get working surround sound through my Denon receiver connected via HDMI ARC to my LG C1 TV when using the MAX or Netflix app. 

To have proper sound without any cutting out I must change the audio on the TV from Auto to PCM. 

When I do this I only get stereo output. 

However. If I use YoutubeTV (also an app) I can have auto audio settings in the TV and surround sound works perfectly. 

If I connect my computer to the TV - perfect surround sound. No cutting out. 

Yet - I currently can’t watch anything on Netflix or MAX without the audio cutting out with surround sound. 

The only change is a different application on the TV. Nothing else changes. 

Idk what to do. What’s the point of paying for these streaming services if you can’t have proper surround sound?

My kid did something I can't figure out how to undo pls help,"My son, 4, had his own profile that I specifically went through and blacklisted certain shows I didn't want him to watch and was set to age appropriate content. The 3 other profiles are password protected so he can't get in them. But he figured out how to edit profiles... like change the names and pictures delete and add. He could do this on both his Amazon Fire and the PS4.

So. He treats adding and deleting profiles like a game. No matter how many times his dad and I tell him to NOT change profiles he continues do do it. He knows he isn't supposed to because whenever he creates a new one he will show you all coy like. Consequently I signed out of Netflix on his tablet and tried to limit his PS4 controller access. It had been a while since I signed him out on his tablet so I decided to give him another chance. Yada Yada Yada never trust a 4 year old now I have this problem.

He seems to have deleted his specifically curated kids profile. He added 2 new profiles and put something in Malaysian which I think I finally was able to put back in English. I have tried deleting the profiles on the app on the PS4 but after I press delete nothing happens... they are still there. I have used the website for full account controlls and when I go to delete there I am met with an error code. Why won't they delete??

Editing to add:
- The PS4 is my husband's not my son's. It is how the family watches TV in the living room

-My son doesn't have unlimited access to electronics all day but when he does have access to Netflix it was nice having a kids profile set for him to block garbage like Cocomelon and the like

-He has had more screen time this week specifically because I'm a SAHM and I also have a 1 year old and this week I have been ungodly sick with a sinus infection.  Normally we go to the library for story time once a week, go to the playground every day it isn't too hot, and I am teaching him prek lessons at home. The week I'm just trying to survive without my head exploding.

"Just finished the final season of Top Boy, and I've got some thoughts... (Spoilers of course)","This was by far the weakest season for me. It just felt rushed. Too many plot points weren't fully addressed.

* Aaron really left his little brother to grow up in a home and fend for himself, after they'd both just witnessed their big bro get killed by Sully. That just feels so wrong to me. Family was such a big thing for them, yet man really just decided to fuck off to Leeds without Stef...
* What happened to Stef's friend Tia? She was literally walking by when Sully killed Jamie, yet there was no mention of her in this season.
* We never even got to see a funeral for Jamie or any of the aftermath. 
* What was actually the point of bringing the Irish gangsters in? What did they actually do? They were introduced as this big bad force and were just offed in 2 episodes. Why not at least link them to Lizzie to give them some more relevance?
* What the fuck happened to Dushane's heart problems that they were building up over the last couple seasons? Literally nothing came of it.
* Dushane also just seemed so fucking stupid here. Why would this guy just leave Jeffrey's body where it was after killing him? He could've easily gotten the crew to help deal with it. Not like it's the first dead body they've had to deal with. Did bro just think that his DNA and fingerprints would magically disappear?
* Jaq stealing the drugs was such a dumb thing to do. why get Kierron involved as well?
* Sully shooting Dushane just felt weird to me man. Dushane has saved his life so many fucking times, yet no one ever brings that up when they're arguing. If anything, I would've preferred Dushane to die from a heart attack when they were talking with the wall between them.

Netflix live-action Cowboy Bebop is better than the anime source material,"Blasphemy!

Back then, I was vaguely aware of Cowboy Bebop but never got around to watching it. When I heard Netflix is pouring money into a live-action adaptation, I thought the anime must be good! The live-action trailer looked really cool! So I decided to watch the anime first.

I loved the music. Loved the animation and style. However, I didn't really enjoy the anime. Too many episodes feel like filler. I get that these are supposed to be a ""bounty of the week"" kind, but I feel it broke up the overarching story too much. I can’t help but compare this to The Mandalorian S1. It has the same bounty of the week format but Mando always gained/learned something in each episode. Whereas in anime Bebop, I can skip many episodes and don’t feel like anything is missing.

Overall, I thought it was just an okay anime but with amazing music.

That being said, I gave the Netflix live-action adaptation a try. First off, I don't care what you think, John Cho nailed it. So what if he's older? He's still effortlessly cool like Spike. Mustafa Shakir somehow managed to improve Jet's character. Daniella Pineda's Faye was slightly different but I still like it. Ein was perfect!

To my surprise, I really enjoyed the Netflix show! Faye is smartly introduced earlier and I love her dynamic with the team. Despite her personality, she really cares about the guys and doesn't randomly go off on her own like in the anime. Jet is, again, vastly improved. He feels like one of the main characters now, instead of like a sidekick in the anime. I love his whole ""I don't care about your past"" thing. Him having a daughter, and not knowing about Spike's involvement in the Syndicate, was a brilliant change.

Every episode builds up the story towards the finale! I was impressed by how they mix and match parts of the anime to create a cohesive plot. For example, Pierrot Le Fou isn't some random guy who happens to attack Spike, he's there because he was hired.

Now, for the elephant in the room: Vicious. Yeah, he sucked balls. Easily the weakest aspect of the live-action series. But you know what? Anime Vicious isn't that good of a villain too. Heck, he barely even showed up. Some would say this makes him mysterious, I say it makes him feel unimportant. Netflix Vicious was overcompensated for this - he has too much screen time that we feel too familiar with him. There's a perfect Vicious somewhere between the anime and Netflix extremes, but right now, both are equally poor characters.

Julia was great. I was looking forward to seeing what she'd do after the finale. Sadly that's not happening.

The show isn't perfect. I thought some jokes didn't really work. There's a clear lack of space adventures but I'm sure that's due to budget constraints. Overall, I think most of the changes they made worked very well. It's different. It's better.

Bonus Unpopular Opinion: I hate Ed in the anime. She barely contributes anything to the crew and the story. I liked how the Netflix show did away with her but was bummed she showed up at the end. She’s still annoying. I don’t get why people like anime Ed but hate Netflix Ed. If anything, the actor did a great job of being faithful to the character.

Oh well, I guess it's too late that the show got too many negative reviews that a Season 2 will not happen.

‘Marco Polo’ has real sets and real Asians so it has potential (REVIEW) [US],"**Marco Polo is based on the famed explorer’s adventures in Kublai Khan’s court in 13th century China. It a historical drama meets bad martial arts movie version of The Matrix.**

[Full review here](http://nowstreamingpod.com/2014/12/fell-asleep-watching-marco-polo-woke-liking/)
 


 
Today marks the release of Marco Polo, the new Netflix original series. With 10 episodes at an hour each you're getting plenty of entertainment for your monthly fee, the big discussion point for most people is that the show is trying to be a poor mans Game of Thrones... but in order to be like GoT it'd have to be stellar right off the bat. Most Netflix shows tend to fall into the same trap; since they're releasing all the episodes at once the shows take a little time to build up momentum and when they're in full speed they're unstoppable! But despite the jaw dropping trailer for the show, Marco Polo seems to be no different.

I stayed up to watch the pilot of the show last night and as soon as that clock struck midnight I pressed play. Two minutes later the power goes out due to the only storm to hit Los Angeles in years. Instead of bitching about it the entire night on social media, I only did that for about 20 minutes before I went into my bathroom (better acoustics) and watched it on my phone until the power came back on. I didn't want to watch the show like that, especially since I just got a 55 inch TV. Even though I was watching on a small screen I was able to grasp the story before I started to re-watch it on a real screen.


The series starts with Marco (Lorenzo Richelmy, who looks like a Persian Bam Margera) being gifted to Kublai Khan (Benedict Wong) by his father as incentive to allow him access to the Silk Road. Khan quickly finds use for Marco as a spy and sends him on little missions that conveniently last 50 minutes! If you watch the opening scene with the sound off you'll be blown away by the cinematography and the fact that they have real sets and real Asians. Already the show is light-years ahead of Last Samurai and 47 Ronin. Everything looks like it has what it takes to be a strong show... and then they start talking. Show creator and writer John Fusco's words almost immediately fall flat, the script is full of back-to-back ""epic monologues"" that there's no time for witty banter or anything that seems real.

The fight to talk ratio is heavily skewed in the wrong direction, the show has a lot of exposition that they're getting out of the way but it's nothing that a history book from the 5th grade couldn't tell us.  The fighting was very Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon where everything is fantastical and the rules don't apply. The only real fighting takes place during training sessions for Marco to learn how to defend himself and were as exciting as fighting that sounds. The only other fight scene acted as the introduction to our other main character Jing Fei (Shu An Oon) who takes out three men while completely naked. Although the boobage will entice viewers it doesn't mask the lackluster fighting.",0,0.49,37,andrewfurtaco,[USA],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1418412649.0,False,False,False,2014-12-12 19:30:49,marco polo is based on the famed explorers adventures in kublai khans court in th century china it a historical drama meets bad martial arts movie version of the matrix full review here today marks the release of marco polo the new netflix original series with episodes at an hour each youre getting plenty of entertainment for your monthly fee the big discussion point for most people is that the show is trying to be a poor mans game of thrones but in order to be like got itd have to be stellar right off the bat most netflix shows tend to fall into the same trap since theyre releasing all the episodes at once the shows take a little time to build up momentum and when theyre in full speed theyre unstoppable but despite the jaw dropping trailer for the show marco polo seems to be no different i stayed up to watch the pilot of the show last night and as soon as that clock struck midnight i pressed play two minutes later the power goes out due to the only storm to hit los angeles in years instead of bitching about it the entire night on social media i only did that for about minutes before i went into my bathroom better acoustics and watched it on my phone until the power came back on i didnt want to watch the show like that especially since i just got a inch tv even though i was watching on a small screen i was able to grasp the story before i started to rewatch it on a real screen the series starts with marco lorenzo richelmy who looks like a persian bam margera being gifted to kublai khan benedict wong by his father as incentive to allow him access to the silk road khan quickly finds use for marco as a spy and sends him on little missions that conveniently last minutes if you watch the opening scene with the sound off youll be blown away by the cinematography and the fact that they have real sets and real asians already the show is lightyears ahead of last samurai and ronin everything looks like it has what it takes to be a strong show and then they start talking show creator and writer john fuscos words almost immediately fall flat the script is full of backtoback epic monologues that theres no time for witty banter or anything that seems real the fight to talk ratio is heavily skewed in the wrong direction the show has a lot of exposition that theyre getting out of the way but its nothing that a history book from the th grade couldnt tell us the fighting was very crouching tiger hidden dragon where everything is fantastical and the rules dont apply the only real fighting takes place during training sessions for marco to learn how to defend himself and were as exciting as fighting that sounds the only other fight scene acted as the introduction to our other main character jing fei shu an oon who takes out three men while completely naked although the boobage will entice viewers it doesnt mask the lackluster fighting,marco polo has real sets and real asians so it has potential review us,0

__Update:__ The consensus is that this is a Public TV style underwriting and not a true ad, despite its length, multiple cuts and spoken tag line -- Unusual for programming from a for-profit channel like National Geographic.  The bumpers for the other underwriters, NSF and FEI were innocuous and non distracting.  I guess subtlety is not one of defense contractors' strong suits. False alarm?

Why I think Squid game is overrated,"1. The organ trafficking subplot was not only a pointless concept but the execution was also horrible: does the series want us to believe that organ trafficking takes place in a damp cellar, with no support to the doctor and with no proper equipment? And all of those scenes were so dragged on.
2. The police subplot, particularly the big reveal in the end regarding the Frontman, was anticlimactic: so the series focuses on the players themselves, besides them, we partially get to know the family of Gi-hun, but literally noone else. The tension they tried to build up in the end was really misplaced. I was totally indifferent who this Operator guy is, because I just didn’t know anyone besides the players.
3. The ‘fairness’ element: both the Creator old man and the Frontman voice on several occasions that ‘fairness’ is an essence of the games, but this is far from the truth. How on earth was the bridge game fair? The first contestant had literally zero chance to survive, meanwhile the last participant was in a good position.
4. The ‘psychopath and pervert rich people’ cliché
5. Some characters were very inconsistent throughout the show: for example during the marble game episode (which is the highlight of the show I think), I did not get at all why Ji-yeong would sacrifice herself for Sae-byeok, especially why it was presented as a deliberate decision. If I remember correctly, she stated in the end that she picked Sae-byeok, so that the latter could win (she didn’t even know what the game is going to be at that point). And I did not get the fury of the protagonist in the end either. I mean the Creator guy was right, they could leave after the first game, by which they were aware of the point of the whole event, but they decided to come back. Now he wants to pit an end to the whole thing. But why lol? He could have done this already upon leaving for the first time but he rather decided to play.",9,0.53,63,Tomieez,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1634976280.0,False,False,False,2021-10-23 08:04:40,the organ trafficking subplot was not only a pointless concept but the execution was also horrible does the series want us to believe that organ trafficking takes place in a damp cellar with no support to the doctor and with no proper equipment and all of those scenes were so dragged on the police subplot particularly the big reveal in the end regarding the frontman was anticlimactic so the series focuses on the players themselves besides them we partially get to know the family of gihun but literally noone else the tension they tried to build up in the end was really misplaced i was totally indifferent who this operator guy is because i just didnt know anyone besides the players the fairness element both the creator old man and the frontman voice on several occasions that fairness is an essence of the games but this is far from the truth how on earth was the bridge game fair the first contestant had literally zero chance to survive meanwhile the last participant was in a good position the psychopath and pervert rich people clich some characters were very inconsistent throughout the show for example during the marble game episode which is the highlight of the show i think i did not get at all why jiyeong would sacrifice herself for saebyeok especially why it was presented as a deliberate decision if i remember correctly she stated in the end that she picked saebyeok so that the latter could win she didnt even know what the game is going to be at that point and i did not get the fury of the protagonist in the end either i mean the creator guy was right they could leave after the first game by which they were aware of the point of the whole event but they decided to come back now he wants to pit an end to the whole thing but why lol he could have done this already upon leaving for the first time but he rather decided to play,why i think squid game is overrated,0

Yes, there are also lots of shows that get renewed but, about 80-90% are boring and repetitive.

Dear Netflix: The Queue is STUPID,"I don't understand why Netflix has such a shitty navigation system. The idea of a queue is so far separated from how people of our generation consume media that it blows my mind. It's awkward and regimented and stiff and just the exact opposite of how things should be set up. Instead of a fucking queue, there should be a library that you curate yourself. I want one place that has all of the TV shows that I actually like, and the movies that I can actually see myself having on a DVD rack in my house - something that mirrors the way we actually want to use Netflix.

I don't want your shitty suggestions for ""Witty TV Comedies."" I want to be able to see Arrested Development, Archer, The Office, Parks and Rec, The League, and Party Down lined up in a library that I put together myself, so I can just pick up an episode at any time and start watching. How does that not make more sense than a queue? Just because I watched Season 1 of Arrested Development doesn't mean that it should disappear from my queue and get lost into the magical Netflix-land of terabytes and terabytes of shitty fucking 1950s television programs, the only fans of which probably can't turn on a computer, much less use Netflix.

Don't get me wrong - the queue makes perfect sense for their DVD-by-mail service, but in the context of streaming media, it's a fucking nightmare.  Anyone agree?

TL;DR: Netflix Queue is stupid, should be a library of your favorite shows and movies.

**EDIT:** Alright, I understand that the Instant Queue *IS* a list, and you can theoretically use it just like a favorites section.  That said, do you really think that's the optimal setup?  There should be a section called Favorites or My Library or something that is just as aesthetically pleasing and easy to use as Netflix's homepage.  Your favorite movies and TV shows deserve better than an ugly queue-style list.

**EDIT 2:** Okay, things don't actually disappear from the Instant Queue when you're done watching them.  Whatever, the system still sucks.

Hot take: Netflix are not the villains for cancelling shows,"Traditional US TV networks for decades and still to this day have been cancelling underperforming shows, sometimes even after a few episodes! The big difference being that those networks don’t have 100% accurate viewer information as they use the Nielsen ratings system which is based on a sample of the population, whereas Netflix can actually see which shows are performing well and which are underperforming. 

It’s not the best when your favourite series gets cancelled but for Netflix it’s a business just like for other streaming services and TV stations why would you throw more good money out with the bad just to wrap up a series, instead show makers should wrap up things themselves within the season so in the off chance they’re cancelled they haven’t ended their show on a cliffhanger.",0,0.5,20,FilmUncensored,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1675621772.0,False,False,False,2023-02-05 18:29:32,traditional us tv networks for decades and still to this day have been cancelling underperforming shows sometimes even after a few episodes the big difference being that those networks dont have accurate viewer information as they use the nielsen ratings system which is based on a sample of the population whereas netflix can actually see which shows are performing well and which are underperforming its not the best when your favourite series gets cancelled but for netflix its a business just like for other streaming services and tv stations why would you throw more good money out with the bad just to wrap up a series instead show makers should wrap up things themselves within the season so in the off chance theyre cancelled they havent ended their show on a cliffhanger,hot take netflix are not the villains for cancelling shows,0

Am I the only one that didn’t find squid games that entertaining?,"This is obviously an unpopular opinion but I wonder if anyone relates.

 I’ve always enjoyed the death game genre and as far as the genre goes Squid Games just doesn’t really stand out or do anything new.
I found the games to be, for the most part generic and dull (aside from the red light green light, which was coincidently stolen from another death game movie “As The Gods Will” anyway). 

I found the two major twists highly predictable, as well as the final game and it’s final players. The only thing that wasn’t predictable imo was the ending, which I predicted would be more entertaining. 

The ending, especially **that** twist was boring, it felt pseudo-philosophical and the pacing was horridly slow. Not edge of your seat slow, or thought provokingly cerebral slow, but “wake me up when it’s over” slow. 

The main character really doesn’t offer much interest, he isn’t smart, he isn’t even very capable, he’s just nice. Which is good and all, but not the most entertaining. In fact looking back I wish the girl had been the main character, at least she was interesting. Still, when compared to other death game titles, even the ones on Netflix like “Gantz” or “Alice in Borderland” I found it to be lackluster and unoriginal. The shocking moments weren’t that shocking to me, and the dramatic deaths didn’t feel that dramatic. The games in AoB were at least interesting and thought provoking and the main character was smart which made him interesting to watch. SG however brought nothing new to the genre, in fact I found it doing things many other titles in the genre do well, worse.

"Thank You, Netflix","Yeah, it's all the rage to be raging at Netflix these days but, personally, I'd like to thank them for helping me get through the past two years. Kinda shocking that people are so quick to turn on the service that brought us both *Tiger King* and *Squid Game*, both very entertaining shows when we all **needed** a distraction.

Actually, without Netflix, there would *be* no *Squid Game, Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, Stranger Things, Big Mouth, Love, Death & Robots, Queer Eye,* or *Murderville* \- all are original Netflix programming. They also gave a lot of shows - that other streaming services didn't - a chance and, when viewers dropped, they were forced to drop the shows, but are always adding / creating new ones.

I was first introduced to quality shows like *Ozark, Bojack Horseman, Derry Girls, Orange is the New Black,* and *Bodyguard* on Netflix. Almost all the best standup / comedy specials were brought to us by Netflix, and  upcoming original Netflix stuff like *That's My Time with* *David Letterman*, Cunk on Earth, and the new *Ricky Gervais* look promising.

"I think I might be ""done"" with Netflix","First I lost the whole discovery of new videos by finding someone with similar taste ratings (89% similar, 77% similar, etc), then I lost the ability to have multiple tabs open to ""queue"" up my videos and had to use their clunky listing, then they started putting in annoying video ads including a big top banner one that autoplays, then they got rid of user reviews and kept a dumbed down Facebook-like system of thumbs up/thumbs down (with rumors they did it because their in-house productions were getting bad reviews).  There have been plenty of annoyances and changes beyond this, but those are the highlights.

I put done in quotes because I think I might change my viewing habits. There are a few things I still want to see. Rather than keeping a year round subscription, I think I might start suspending it for 11 months out of the year and then binging for 1 month on all the content I want.

What is sad is I have been a loyal customer for a long time - back when they were mainly a DVD service and just starting up a streaming library. I also have Amazon Prime and was considering dumping that this year, but I think I'll now keep prime for the free shipping and year-round video streaming service and make Netflix my secondary.  I do appreciate that they aren't as ad heavy, and I tried sticking to my guns and never signing up for all the splinter streaming services (voting with my dollars to tell studios license your crap to Netflix rather than try to make their own service... but apparently people want to pay a la carte for 20 different services and wind up paying more than they do for cable channels, so I have lost and Netflix's library has crumbled - and is becoming more ad-like in intrusiveness).

I guess I'm just bummed. Its an end of an era for me, and it sucks that for me Netflix is finally ""dead"" as a service option.  I kept hoping and hoping the situation would change, but they kept going down the avenues that I didn't enjoy. So Amazon Prime streaming and reading books it is.

Thanks for letting me vent here.

So, how about the rest of you. How long have you been a Netflix customer? Are you happy with the direction they are going, or are you bummed out like me?

3 Netflix TV Shows That You Need To Check Out! [ALL],"So in case you guys didn't know, I am a HUGE Netflix addict. My high school was lenient enough to allow phone use in class, which led to me finishing about 3 different series (all at least 5 seasons long) during classes that I didn't need to focus in. After a ridiculous amount of time spent on the movie/tv show watching service, I figured I would share my Top 3 Netflix TV Shows you might want to check out. I just want to mention that if you think of a TV Show that I should have put in the top 3, voice your opinion in the comments! Discuss! I'm only saying what I think are 3 of the top shows. So here they are! (No particular order)

Prison Break (4 Seasons / 2005-2008) 
Being incredibly produced/directed, this show is nothing but plot twists, intense moments, and cliffhangers. If you want a show that leaves you shocked and drooling for the next episode, you want to watch this show. It is the story of a structural engineer and his brother who was wrongly convicted of a major murder. Due to his knowledge of the prison, and faith in his brother's innocence, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) gets himself arrested to help his brother break free. The intense, unpredictable and well written story-line keeps your toes curled and knuckles white through every minute of the show. Definitely one of my favourites, and worth looking into.

Psych (8 Seasons / 2006-2014) 
This is definitely one to check out. It is all about the crazy and hilarious adventures of a hyper-observant man named Shawn Spencer (James Roday and his quirky friend Gus (Dulé Hill). According to the friends of these two, Shawn is psychic, due to a facade he gave the police when they brought him in initially. What is really going on in that brain of his, is the ability to see and notice things that no average person would catch. Thanks to the lies of being psychic, and the amazing talent Mr. Spencer has, they get into trouble often. Luckily for us, its all a TV Show that we can enjoy. If you want a good show with a great sense of humour and some pretty faces, this show is a good start.

Sherlock (3 Seasons / 2010-Current)
If you want a great show, and have time to watch 90 minute episodes often enough, then this is a great show and cannot be overlooked. In the incredible and unique perspective of a classic story, Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his side-kick Dr. Watson (Martin Freeman) keep the world safe in ways you wouldn't expect from normal crime-fighting shows, mostly because this is nothing like a normal crime-fighting show. Loaded to the brim with intense scenes, superb stories, and the incredible mind of Sherlock, there is no way this show won't make you show some sort of interest. If you want some sort of ""different from the usual Crime-Fighter"" TV Show, look no further, because you just found your soul-mate-show, or whatever. 

Honorable Mentions: Californication (American TV Series, Lie To Me (American TV Series), Houdini (Only 2 Episodes = Movie/Show)

If you disagree, or you think I missed something, let me know!

Thanks for checking me out, and make sure to leave criticism, or some love if you feel the need! <3

I kept Netflix from day 1 absolutely day 1 and then after all the things they've done wrong like what they did to the cIeopatra show so tried canceling thinking it would be impossible

turns out I don't miss it I was conditioned to think I need it but it's the most expensive streaming service of them all, they only focus on original content with the same cliche things, I realized Netflix is no longer worth the money you get multipliple services for over 50% less you get much better value from Disney+ for example a wide variety of really good originals often, then star makes that even more value.

So if you need money try canceling you may be happy with that decision I think Netflix only is good in visual quality but they used to be amazing but they are a part of the past and they are too confident with the pricing they were amazing as it was a one of a kind service that included everything it was needed.

Too Much Negativity,"Some Netflix users are so entitled in particular in this sub (including me).. 

Before the downvote damocles strikes lemme explain: I understand all the points/requests recently made; that is clearer UI, no preview, better Originals Movies, and no advertising. I agree 1000%. 

But I think the fact some partake in the hate bangwagon is unjustified. Everybody has been saying the current model (with mainstream, regular series and movies whose licences are expensive to buy) is unsustainable with the current price tag and dependency on licences to work. And yet now that Netflix pushes for Originals and, well, intends to price up to maintain the catalogue people are surprised and whine all the time about everything. There are drawbacks to using Netflix and I hope the threats in response to aforementioned issues will make Netflix move but those are far outweighed by advantages such as: no real advertisement anyway (I can put up with trailers way more than ads for the latest perfume), low price, quality content (although not recent enough but having series such as Skins or Doctor Who or many oscar-winning movies at your fingertip without moving your fat ass is great). By quality content I dare include Originals such as the Crown, Stranger Things, Sense 8, Gerald's Game, Annihilation, Lost in Space, Okja and so on. You also can share your account, change language (believe me among the likes of Google movies you liking and speaking other languages is something that is still not figured out), change subs font and color (petty but useful), use many platforms, resume watching, create lists etc. and it doesn't ruin your internet connection.

Today my subscription was canceled because of my nationality.,"Yes, as you may have guessed I am from Russia and Netflix voluntary ‘sanctions’ kicked in. I know this is not a place and you are not the people I shall complain to, but I am currently very sad and just wanted to share.

I know why they did this, I of course watch all kind of news. And I feel very sorry for what people in Ukraine go through. But still I feel let down. I’ve been Netflix subscriber for the past 4-5 years. I could have pirated any content Netflix offers, but I did not. I did not because I respect other people’s work and efforts they put into creating this platform and content. I am mature enough for that and paid for this out of my pocket. I have been a faithful customer to this service. 

And now they don’t even let me finish my new month, cancel it because of what? A trend to cancel everything in Russia? I am sorry, but that is what it is. Because this does not affect people responsible for the horrible things happening in Ukraine in any way. I’ll tell you more - the majority of people who support Putin (if there are still such people) do not even watch Netflix cuz they do not have the courtesy to pay for content! These are the types of people who pirate everything (and also anti-vax). Literate people, who are able to watch shows in English just so happen to be against the war. And yet, you punish us for being Russians. This is sad and makes me angry. Not at government, but at the big corporations that care only about their PR. 

I know this post will probably be buried, but I feel a bit better now that I typed all this.

The last thing I want to say - if you think these sanctions is what shall make people overthrow Putin, then you don’t know the situation well. We cannot. Once I go on a demonstration, I will go to jail and my parents lose jobs. We are captives too, but at least I used to have my piece of freedom - being able to watch what I want for the money I pay. Now this and many other things are gone. You should not have antagonized us, guys. We civilized Russians wanted to cooperate, not alienate.

"I'm in the middle of The Witcher Season 2, and having american diversity forced on me starts to get annoying","I know, I know, a lot has been said about racial diversity in Fantasy and on TV in general. I get the idea of representation in media, I think it's basically a good thing, and I'm not about wether it is possible for an elf to be black or not.

My problem is: the minorities represented are US-american minorities, even though Netflix is streamed globally and most subscribers are outside the US. There's no Arabs, no Indians, no Pakistanis, no Romani, no Rohingya or whatever minorities there are in the world. Diversity in movies and series mostly means adding black people.

It's especially annoying in the Witcher series, not only because this is an adaption of a book from the other side of the globe, but mainly because the franchise already does an outstanding job depicting racism. One of the main features that made The Witcher oustanding in the genre is how dark and realistic it is: societies already are incredibly diverse and chock full of racism, all kinds of characters suffer from discrimination because of their origin. It's just that their skin isn't black, but it has to be, because apparently, that defines racism in the US. The USA have a problem with discrimination against african americans, therefore, a fantasy story from poland needs more black people in it, and the whole world has to see. 

If having diversity by adding black actors to the cast helps with your societal issues, fine. But that doesn't mean it has to be clubbed into every series with a sledgehammer. There are other nations beyond US borders, and they have their own issues with racism.

1. The antagonist goes from scene to scene in hysterics. It's nice to see women in power but it's clear that whoever wrote this thinks powerful women are always at the edge of having a meltdown.
2. The writers normalize domestic violence by having the antagonist punch her husband and giver him a black eye. It's almost written as a joke when the embassy staff is wondering why her husband has a bruised face.
3. To notify the audience that the female antagonist antagonist is powerful, they have her constantly abuse her staff. She shouts at them for things like giving her a non-preferred clothing for her international trip. She shouts at them for not doing things fast enough. She shouts at her husband because... screaming at your spouse is okay?

An open letter to Netflix regarding Evangelion,"

Netflix,



It really isn’t you, it’s the whacky world we’re living in. But it’s you too. You aren’t helping. You had it all and you blew it in a multitude of ways.



Neon Genesis Evangelion is a masterpiece of its own distinct class. Its original English dub encapsulates what it truly means to earn the title of being iconic; this western localization rocked the 90s in the United States and has reverberated into otaku culture to an impressive extent all these years later.



Hideaki Anno poured his soul into his work with unabashed blatancy and the original English dub is a soulful representation of that. The new dub was unnecessary aside from saving money. If saving money is what you wanted to do -you should have done it elsewhere. Misato’s charm is all but gone. Ritsuko is so bland it’s painful to hear. Shinji feels dreadfully bored. Asuka’s breakdown in episode 22 was originally tragically harrowing; now? An embarrassment. I could go on. Overall, the acting is generically not in alignment with the *feel* of the show. It robs the essence of the original creation and besmirches a piece of art which demands far more respect than trying to save money before making money off it.



Speaking of saving money. You got rid of Fly Me to the Moon!? Mate. That’s so unbelievably uncool its absence physically made me feel uncomfortable. Do something correctly or just don’t do it.



Speaking of things you **should**. *not*. **have done**. Changing lines? **Changing** *lines*!? What on earth do you think gives you the artistic integrity to make such a flippant call? Some of those changed lines legitimately changed the intensity and implications of certain scenes almost entirely. What an absolute joke.



Is the show watchable? Sure. But whew the soul is just not the same in some striking ways and it’s really a rather large shame considering this will be many people’s first exposure to Evangelion. This art is precious and close to the heart of so many and it’s unbelievably disappointing to see it get used like this...we know better than to take half-steps to pay homage to things like this but we do it anyway because it’s cheaper, or easier, or smoother. Well, if that’s how you want to do business no one can stop you I suppose. But we can speak out about it and you can’t do anything about that.

"How would you feel about an option ""skip sex"" button?","I've always wanted a ""skip sex"" button similar to the ""skip intro"" button that skips sex and nudity. It can be an option so that the button appears if you want it, and doesn't appear for those who don't want it.

I feel like many people from conservative or religious backgrounds would want such a feature, or even people who are sensitive to such content or people who feel awkward watching such scenes with family.

On the other hand, I've seen many people online have a strong negative reaction whenever someone brings this subject up. People say things like ""Go back to the stone age"" or ""If you're sensitive to this stuff, then don't watch it"" or ""It's natural, you wouldn't be here if it didn't happen"". I really don't understand this. What does it matter to them what other people do? Everyone has different values and preferences, and people need to have the maturity and tolerance to accept that. I would like to have the quality entertainment that Netflix provides without having to watch such scenes.

Hollywood is using Netflix incorrectly. [ALL],"Rather than seeing Netflix as a true competitor to Hollywood, (which it most certainly is not) the major studios of Hollywood could sell the rights to their movies for time periods that are much shorter than one year. Think more along the lines of a month-long contract, or even a ""This week, On Netflix!""-style billboard. 

Where fans of TV Shows and movies have extensive lists of Netflix content that they are scheduled to ""binge-watch"" (ie. 7 seasons of Parks and Rec, 11 seasons of Gray's Anatomy, etc.) Hollywood should be more particular about what content they release to Netflix. What if they only released the first season of these shows? Or the first movie of a franchise? Getting people hooked on a show with these introductory elements could lead to increased DVD sales for the companies. 

In refusing to play ball with Netflix, it could decrease that company's value and further reduce that company's effectiveness in the eyes of its consumers. The fact of the matter is, Netflix's strategy so far has been, ""Come for the Hollywood Blockbusters that you know, Stay for the Netflix-created content that you didn't know."" Ultimately, it could help the major studios to jumpstart their own streaming services and create a new order of movie bundles if they simply don't provide the biggest movies. These services could provide On-demand movies from the entire catalogs of their production companies at competitive rates to Netflix (or even more competitive in exchange for ad revenue.) 

Imagine if you could create a world where you could get all of the movie content ever created, on demand, for a monthly rate and the cost of Internet bandwidth, which improves exponentially every year or so anyway.

Army of the Dead is terrible - Stop letting Zach Snyder write he rips off other movies half the time - 1/10,"**Here's a list of movies it ripped off:**

Ocean's 11 (acceptable since that was the whole selling point just starting out weak)

Aliens (basically the entire real plot down to the corporate traitor-except it doesn't make any sense why he's betraying anyone-and the ""You don't see them screwing each other over"" line)

Revenant (bear scene but with a zombie tiger-side note: why did the Tiger just lay down on a car and YAWN after the king zombie ordered them to avenge his dead queen and baby-side side note: glowing zombie baby???)

Predator (This is a little more acceptable cause it's probably been used in other movies but the whole ""I'm probably gonna die cause this is a monster and I'm just a buff dude but let's do this hand-to-hand"" thing at the end with the king zombie and Omari's character)

BVS (Bulletproof cowl. Literally just ripped off his own movie so I guess that's okay but jeez. I just called the king zombie Batman after seeing that)

Riddick (Zombies that come out only when it rains, even though it never happened I'm still putting it there cause this movie deserves no good will)

Indiana Jones (Seriously why does a casino vault have boobytraps? Isn't that a little unsafe for the regular workers and a little illegal to premeditate murder even if it's to protect something?)

Volcano (This is reaching but if you remember that old Volcano movie with Tommy Lee Jones there's a seen where a firefighter saves a child but jumping into lava and then throwing her. Here in the last part of the montage Bautista's soldier comrade is running with the little girl when she gets overwhelmed. Except for some reason after saving the girl she decides to go back and hug this otherwise random soldier she just met and then they drop a cargo box in their heads)

I Am Legend (The whole idea of the there being a zombie king and queen couple and attacking the group cause he wanted her back/to avenge her)

**Other Stuff I Hated:**

Kate - she sucked and if you don't know why you didn't watch the movie.

Geeta - decided to blind herself by staring at a nuclear explosion instead of helping kill the kung-fu king zombie in the helicopter with them.

The German Safecracker - why did they even need him shouldn't Tanaka know the combination to his own safe? If he lost it in Vegas somehow they dont mention that. Other than him being seemingly unnecessary he also is super annoying (screaming like a teen girl might be funny to some people but it made me want him to die) and the fact he paused that whole slo-mo music video section to ask how to kill a zombie (HOW. TO. KILL. A. ZOMBIE) just made me hate him from the beginning.

They didn't save that girl after she had the most awesome, heartpounding scene in the movie - Seriously, that made me hate them all. And the worst part is the guy who was friends with her, the guy who was closest to her, and the guy who in the planning scene got all up in the dude who chicken'd out's face about not wanting to go JUST STOOD THERE AND WATCHED AND THEN BLEW HER UP WHEN SHE GOT BIT.

They kept bringing people last minute even though they couldn't possibly all fit in the helicopter with the money - First Kate, but then the only reason Kate came was to get Geeta so we're already assuming 2 extras. Then the Coyote girl just walks up to the rapist guard and seduces him into coming to, so that's 3 extra bodies somehow fitting on that helicopter with the whole team and all the money. At not point does anyone question it, I almost wish they all made it just to see them try and clown car it out of there.

The traitor dude humping the zombie queen before decapitating her - Zach Snyder has a rape fetish you can't change my mind.

The robot zombies - Don't have much to say other than why? Not even a WHY, just a why? I honestly forgot and now that I remember them I don't really have any hatred. Just why?

The inciting incident - The whole idea of road head causing the zombie apocalypse just doesn't sound good when you say it out loud. Also, why didn't the soldiers who were tasked with protecting the truck take one for the team instead of letting their cargo and fellow soldiers die? I get he was a crap soldier who wasn't paying attention, but that just makes it worse so don't bother defending it. And how'd that dude lose a tooth from swerving into sand?

The Time Loop Thing - Idk if that's ever gonna be explained, but it's dumb. What's could the point of that possibly be? Seems like the loop was broken by the end if there ever was one cause Omari's character is now gonna infect the world.

Bautista's Love Interest - she wasn't bad herself, the issue is I forgot she existed until the very end when she's flirting with Bautista and then dies. When I saw her I thought she was the awesome lady who they didn't save after jumping out the window. Like ""Wait didn't she die why are you flirting with her what's going on?""

The Offering - What was the point of that? Why do zombies just let people walk around if you throw them a person? The queen should've ridden on the zombie tiger like the king did the horse and just captured them all. And why did they turn the rapist guard immediately but keep the women around? I'd say it was so they could be saved but they all died.

That Chris Stuckmann didn't make a Hilariocity out of this - seriously man I was looking forward to that!

**Stuff I Liked:**

The Action - it was good. Thanks for not completely sucking movie.

The Zombie Tiger - probably the best character in the film. I wish he was in the montage or at least they showed a zoo or something. I'm assuming he ate all the other animals but let the king turn a horse cause where were all the other

Pissed about this new Netflix password-sharing 'rule',"1. When I first signed up for Netflix YEARS ago, there was 3 tiers- 1 screen, 2 screens, multi-screens. At some point they changed these tiers into video qualities (480p, 1080p, 4K). But I spent years paying for the service of being able to play on multiple screens. I have no idea when they switched it to 'video quality' instead of number of screens. Had I known that, I would've stepped down my subscription a long time ago because video quality doesnt matter to me. But watching on multiple screens does.
2. I travel for work. How would Netflix know if my family is at home watching from my account and I am on the road watching from a different IP address? Will we not be able to watch at the same time? If so, that is ridiculous. This past month, I've been at 5 different locations. 

I understand from Netflix's point of view of wanting to get rid of password sharers, but if that is the case, just go back to capping the tiers by NUMBER OF SCREENS. This is so incredibly stupid and obnoxious.

Army of the disappointment.,"Wow. Truly disappointing. They spent hundreds of thousands to advertise on Reddit, and we are that up like hot garbage.

"""I'm cancelling Netflix because the keep canceling shows"" - You don't get it","It's really not rocket science. 

There's a world outside of your fandom microcosm that you think is so big. 

If a show, which costs money to create (like shit load) will either bring in more subscribers or significantly affect current subscriber count if it was dropped (I.e. the Office for instance) then the show stays. Because Netflix is a business and obviously the subscriber count is the currency the care about. 

If a show, again it cost money to make, has no affect on subscriber count whether it is there or not (in any significant way) and it is not bringing in new subscribers, then off it goes. 

It's that simple. Why make a thousands posts bout it and turn it into some stupid straw man meme?

Glass Onion was a HUGE disappointment.,"I watched Glass Onion for the first time yesterday and basically nothing worked for me. I'll have to admit I really liked the joke in the beginning when Andi breaks the box... but that was basically it. I dont care about any of the characters. The story itself is quite simple but told in a way that makes it feel needlessly complicated. Some characters contribute absolutely nothing, like Lionel. You can literally just cut him out and absolutely nothing changes. Basically none of the jokes landed. 

The whole ""Do we win an iPad?"" sequence is a perfect example of how Rian constantly sacrifices his own story and his characters for some cheap comedy. That kind of humor feels like it belongs in a bad sitcom. And to top it off, when Blanc follows Miles to his office in the next scene, Miles throws him an iPad!!! But... Miles makes a big speech about hating technology and makes a bit thing about not even owning a phone. And yet he had an iPad??? So does that mean he expected Blanc to come to the island and make that joke????? 

None of this makes any sense. And it's irritating as f%$#.

And if you suspect I'm some ""Wokeness is ruining the world!!!"" right winger that couldn't be further from the truth. This has ZERO to do about ""politics"". 

The main problem with the film is that Rian Johnson creates a universe where the characters dont follow their own logic. Take for instance Blanc. He is a very sympathetic and charasmatic character that seems to really care deeply about Helen. Yet, in the end he sends her off on what seems to be a suicide mission, and as the whole things blows up, (And we, the audience, thinks everyone has been killed) Blanc is just sitting watching it from afar with a smile on his face. Like... what? Shouldn't he be hella concerned about the person whom he has spent all this time trying to help?

There are a million of these moment in the film where the writer, Rian, betrays his own characters, just for a laugh. 

And the writing itself is also extremely lacy and FILLED with super old cliches. Like when Helen is shot, but the twist is that the bullet hits something she had in her pocket... COME ON!!!! And how convenient, Blanc has some hot saue in his pocket. Really??? Does anyone watch that and think, ""Yeah, that was really clever writing!!!""??? The only detail in that scene that was genuinely original was the hot sauce moving closer and closer to her nose/eyes. But again, instead of actually creating a suspenseful sequence out of that bit, he plays it off as a dumb joke.

And dont get me started on the whole ""Miles is dumb"" so everything that doesn't make sense is explained, BS.


As Jean-Luc Godard once said, ""the best way to criticize a film is to make another film"". And the best way to describe everything that is wrong with Glass Onion, is to have you watch a GREAT ""whodunnit"" done right.

“Blonde” is an absolute masterpiece and it does not deserve the hate it is getting,"If you are one of those who say that “Blonde” is a bad movie I think you have misunderstood the whole point. 

1. The movie is not a biopic. It even says so in the beginning, it is inspired by a book. 

2. It is not supposed to be taken literally. What it does is reflect the pain of Marilyn Monroe but not only her, the pain of many women. 

3. It is not supposed to be received like its historical correct - no, it is supposed to make us feel and reflect. And oh boy it made me feel! All the stuff that happened or didnt happen in the movie is all a part of making us feel the desperation and the pain she might have felt during her life. 

First of all did Ana de Armas KILL this. She was absolutely amazing. Must have been so incredibly hard to make this movie but she did it.

Secondly - this movie shows us what is wrong with society from a womans point of view. It is extreme, i know, but this is the whole essence of sexism and the experiences women go through. 
I can take so much of what i saw in this movie and point out stuff in my own life and say: this is what happened to me too. 

No matter how much she is suffering, no matter how much is done to her, she needs to keep up her appearance because the people, the world only care about what she can offer them: her body and her sexuality. The men sexualise her constantly and everyone making movies for her forces her into roles that she doesn’t necessarily want. 
When she makes a profit of this sexuality that people force her into, he gets shamed and abused by the people who should have protected her. 
People only gave her love and attention for her sexuality but punished her for it in the same time. She (and many other women) never stood a chance. 

The WAY it was portrayed in this movie was BRILLIANT. It made it crystal clear how f’ed up society really is. This was the point!! To make us feel disgusted with society.

"Do you think any shows canceled by Netflix will be resurrected/sold in the next few years? If so, which ones?","TLDR: With how Netflix has been slowly falling to its demise the past few years (especially now more then ever), do you think its possible for previously canceled shows to be renewed, or the rights to these shows to be sold to other streaming services?

So I was just about to start 1899, after finishing Dark and loving every minute of it. I understand its already been canceled and that the first season ends on a cliffhanger which may never be resolved. Though this isnt the first time that I’ve decided to watch a show that’s already been canceled or was canceled after I’ve watched it (ex: Warrior Nun, I Am Not Okay With This, The Society, Archive 81, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, The Order, V-Wars, Tiny Pretty Things, Fate: The Winx Saga, Greenhouse Academy, Alexa and Katie, No Good Nick, Raising Dion, etc) I was just interested in everyones thoughts on if Netflix will ever have the decency or a smart thought and renew some already canceled shows? Netflix itself seems like its slowly falling to its demise which will only be increased when the cr*ck down with p*sswrd sh*ring starts (later this year). Assuming things for Netflix only get worse, I thought they might try some attempts to get out of the hole they’ve dug themselves, by renewing some of these dead shows to bring previously lost subscribers back.

[ALL] Making a Murderer - Propaganda putting innocent lives at stake.,"MAM is a huge success for Netflix but it is also a propaganda piece that doesn't meet the standards of documentary journalism and also likely libel by implicating innocent people as suspects which has led to a lot of hate and threats being directed at them. I think the show is deeply irresponsible and profit over ethics has taken precedence. This is about a murdered woman - not making a convicted murderer famous. The family of the victim refused to take part in the 'documentary' because the film makers crossed well over the line separating themselves from the subject matter.

The framing conspiracy theory has been smashed to pieces online but MAM needs it to implicate innocent people. If the planned followup doesn't address what we now know then its just another Ancient Aliens but with real peoples whose lives are still being put at risk. That's the difference.

For example,

Steven Avery refuses to explain things today leaving his supporters guess his answers for him.

Steven Avery's face superimposed over the composite is not the only match. Allen's face also matches. The woman who was raped by Allen has stated she made a mistake not that there is a conspiracy.

SA has no alibi.

SA took his first afternoon off on that fateful day.

SA used hidden caller ID exclusively to call the victim twice before she arrived and then didn't use it after she arrived in one final call before her connection was completely terminated.

Her burned out phone and other items were found near his home in a burn barrel.

His dog on a lead was eating bones out off a burn pit behind his home he claimed he had no knowledge about.

The cut on the outside of his middle finger matches the blood spots found in the ignition of her SUV. Its his blood.

He changed his story about if she was in his home or not.

He was a convicted felon for a kidnapping attempt and yet kept a rifle over his bed. Prison didn't teach him anything it seems.

Brendan Dassey correctly led LE to a 3 x 3 bleach clean up in a dirty garage that is still dirty. Bleach isn't used to clean fluid spills. Sand is. Why only clean this one little spot and why did SA need him? BD has bleach on his jeans. Even his mom Barb thought it all odd and blamed SA.

SA omitted this clean up happened from his homicide interview.

SA was seen near a burning barrel despite claiming he burned nothing for 2 weeks.

The EDTA experiment falsified the blood planting hypothesis and the Oxford peer reviewed paper has never been scientifically refuted till this very day.

A nurse was willing to testify she made the hole in the blood vial and its normal procedure.

The blood vial box had a label explaining why it had been opened.

His lawyers still make false claims about this vial today.

Despite being questioned over Halbachs disappearance and being the last person to see her he never bothered to inform his own lawyers despite being in the middle of a litigation.

Lack of DNA/blood is NOT exculpatory by law.

And there is tons more... Reddit has a wiki at r/StevenAveryIsGuilty

Do you think Netflix airing MAM given the hell it has put Halbachs family through and implicating innocent people is fair even though awareness of the film makers omissions of evidence pointing to his guilt has been deliberately left out?

Imagine if the same was done for Ted Bundy or Gary Ridgeway or the DC snipers... painting the victims families or friends in a dark light. It wouldn't matter to much to me but with MAM innocent lives are in the process of being ruined and the film makers have recently said they are going to be making a new episode about his new lawyer... and nothing about their omissions on his guilt.

How do I tell Netflix to never ever present any Indian videos or TV in my feed?,"I'm trying to fine tune what's presented to me and I simply don't, won't and will not ever watch Indian movies or TV.  It's simply nothing that appeals to me.  If this is the case, why do I have to go about downvoting the ones that appear in New Releases every few days and why can't I remove the ones I've downvoted?  Why can't I say, ""don't waste any of my time and space in my feed giving me things I will not ever watch and never ever add them to my feed?""  

Basically, if you can't do this, then Netflix is pushing stuff to people that they don't want.  So why can't we simply apply a filter to say, ""don't waste my time with this content""?

Just finished The Order.,"It's awful don't waste your time. The acting is awkward, the dialogue between characters is disjointed and the story line is mediocre at best. Don't get me started on the werewolf cgi or the soundtrack. This is not one of Netflixes best.

&#x200B;

It's like they tried to remake The Magicians, but somehow made it worse. It's not even cheese bad. It's just bad.

&#x200B;

Supernatural is a better show and not because of Jensons Ackles candy apple ass. It's just better than The Order so that should give you an idea of what you're getting into should you decide to watch The Order.

&#x200B;

I can never get this time back. I don't even care that I was sick and stuck in bed. Terrible show.

Sorry Netflix I'm sure plenty of people enjoyed it. I'm just not one of them and honestly? I hope no one else wastes their time on this litter-box pretending to be prime entertainment.

Why does Netflix hate their customers?,"I just got off the phone with Netflix Customer service to ask how to turn off the new preview service. This is the thing where is plays a preview for the show you are looking at in the browsing menu, automatically, with sound.

Later in the call, he admitted that he suffered the same issues on his Xbox and that he hated it. He said he actively mutes the sound while browsing, and suggested that as a fix because the feature cannot be turned off. I left the Netflix beta 6 months ago because I hated the feature so much. Things have been great since then! Netflix waits to make noise and play shows until I tell it to. Well, now the service is back on both my Roku and on my Vizio TV.

Reviewing night agent. And whats wrong w netflix.,"Took me some time to realize this. Ive never made the connection bw the netflix algo for producing shows and the quality. Obviously there was a connection. I think night agent makes it obvious to me now. 

Its not entirely this shows fault. Its just the pattern of shows like this that night agent just helped me figure out. 

The entire goal is around making people binge. Every so often, for whatever reason they release shows like this to help their investors believe netflix has the magic still. It could be metrics like time spent watching or percentage who complete the series. 

So with that in mind, it makes perfect sense why they allowed a show like night agent to exist. It has the bingeable quality. Mainly, rapid scene changes bw action scenes, and quick, emotive dialog scenes. 

The key is action that is cheap. Car chases, shootings. Few if any of which are brilliantly done. 

Ea dialog scene is filled w emotion. Anger. Rage. Crying. Fear. By keeping the dialog tied to obvious strong emotions they probably know people will watch. 

Which is why the night agent producers dont care if characters are inappropriate w one another, tonally off. If plot points are inconsistent. If directing is confusing. 

Doesnt matter that the characters act serious one scene and make awkward jokes. Or that the chemistry is forced. Or that a secrer service agent or fbi agents wouldnt behave the way they claim.  

These arent important to the algo. 

Its rubbish.

Removal of Chris Brown's documentary from Netflix,"After some deliberation and discussion, I decided to start this petition for the removal of Chris Brown's documentary from Netflix.  If you read the blurb in the petition it pretty much sums up why I feel this way, but in a nutshell, Chris Brown brutally beat the shit out of a woman to the point where she was barely recognisable, amongst various other allegations post that battery charge.  

If Netflix are content to fire Kevin Spacey from House of Cards and terminate the show after it's 6th season amid recent allegations of child sex abuse by Spacey, SURELY they can apply the same logic to a repeat offender of violence against women, not promote and give him air time to try and justify or ""share his side of the story"".  

Violence against women is not okay. 

Please, I implore you to sign and share this petition.  Your support would mean a lot to me, as I know it would many other women.

The Haunting of Bly Manor was a total failure,"Let me just say beforehand that Hill House was absolutely flawless to me. Incredible storytelling, excellent writing, stellar cast and directing. It was an intensely emotional and often genuinely stressful ride. 

Bly Manor is a poor attempt at replicating it. 

Honestly ? It's just really bad. Very early on you just know that they have nothing to say, that the show is going nowhere, actually running in circles. It's one of the most redundant and repetitive shows I've ever seen. The pacing is off all the time because it's constantly dragged out, scenes that shouldn't even be in the final cut last for what seems like forever, it's extremely slow and tedious. On top of that, it's very predictable and kind of cliché ? By episode 3/4 you already figured out everything there is to know but they just keep on explaining stuff and revealing stuff that you already know. It's expository as hell and it's really disappointing considering the quality of the writing on the first season. The characters are very one dimensional, some storylines are useless, some episodes are useless too. By the end when it should be at its climax, everything fell flat because I had no emotional ties to any character : they're just not interesting... at all. 

Everything else is great though, which is all the more frustrating. The cast is incredible, the directing and cinematography are great, it's a gorgeous show (albeit very dark, I often barely saw anything on the screen..) with a great score but oh so shallow and devoid of any emotion and substance. 

I'm very, very disappointed. I was skeptical when they announced another season was coming and it seems they proved me right.

Squid game is fucking shit,"I saw a post saying how Squid Game was rejected for nearly 10 years, which honestly I can see why now, props to the Netflix team who have done well in marketing a mediocre series to people who haven't before been exposed to Korean cinema before but a first for everything I guess.

I hate people asking if I've watched it, how good is it? How deep is it, it's so dark so heavy. I've heard praises such as how it is one of the best Netflix shows of all time, alongside ""Stranger Things"", etc. I am quite impressed at how popular the series has become and I believe it is also the first Korean show that many people have seen, but I may be wrong. I've heard people labelling it as very 'dark' and 'heavy' which is common in Korean movies and series but usually more, then again many people who have watched this are probably not so familiar with Korean cinema and how twisted they can make things, to which I personally found many moments in this movie were so shallow to the point where I was thinking how fucking stupid is this show. It just had a really cool concept.

You got Ali, nice guy who somehow is in million dollars of debt and the writers turned him into a piece of toilet paper to wipe your ass with, ""sorry sir, thank you sir"". I was ok at the start then I was like maybe give this guy some more words to work with you know? Then he wins a game, gets fucking abused and accused of cheating, wow Ali fuck this guy right you're definitely gonna kill him now that he shows his true colours...wait no way dude a ball sack necklace for my marbles!!!! Ok, the cold girl Sa-Byeok, should've been the won to win, the youngest and has a little brother, I thought I saw a bit of foreshadowing because her friend killed herself for her, gets killed by a shard of glass? Which exploded in the celebration? Ok, I say it killed her because no way she was going to survive they pretty much killed her there and then like there was no point whatsoever to do that.

Not much to say about the VIP's because I think we're all on board how shit it was maybe in Korean it sounded cool but i genuinely think they put an ad in Korea looking for old white men to say a few words because that acting was so fucking shit whether it be the expressions or the dialogue they were given. The police plot was pointless and a waste of time the games were still going and the masked guy was on a fucking jetski looking for the police guy, like even i stopped caring about the game, then it was his brother wow ok can't wait to see the dialogue between them. In season 2 maybe? Because he needs to go back and end the game himself instead of using his millions of dollars to idk hire a squad of fucking black ops army soldiers to infiltrate them.

The only good thing this series had going was Sang-woo, my boy played the game how it should've been played, either he or the girl should've won. They literally invited people back for a second chance like what the fuck was that married couple doing there, and in the end he tries to kill Gi-Hun which i dont know why he struggled to do so because hes built like a fucking brick, and then Gi-hun gets all sad when he dies?

Definitely should not be a second season for this, the writing was just all over the place, it seems like the writer had really cool ideas but didnt know when to implement them or how he could drag the series out. I just found myself asking but like where is it going? Is this policeman going to do something big to interfere in the games or?

"Netflix, please, you can't just rely on Witcher.","What happened to Netflix's apparent one-time goal of producing nerd pleasing sci-fi with bite? This gripe goes back to them losing The Exapanse to Amazon, becasue the show simply has not been replaced, and they are now axing more sci-fi with potential to be more than shite tween-drama. I just finished watching Altered Carbon season 2, yes it was hard work. I am not surprised they have canceled season 3. Season 2 was a pale shadow of season 1.

No characters with  venom, no sex, no cynicism, lots of violence to try make up for it...it does not - Call of duty is full of violence too, and popular with kids for a reason. The  entire season is plagued by a feeling of what I can only describe as woke censorship and a lack of spine. And boy did season 2 miss James Purefoy's acting and delivery. Never underestimate what having an actor who has actual stage experience can do to drag an entire show up to standard.

Terrible. What a waste  of potential. I dont think netflix have many other interesting IPs (If I'm ignornat of some shows they are doing/have al;ready made, please enlighten me)...

"Wednesday: More proof that you are stupid and executives know you are compliant in your ""brand loyalty"".","Wednesday is a bad show. Framed inside the very well established Addams Family social understanding so half the writing is already done and the show can afford to be VERY lazy. And it shows... The demographic for this show is clearly 8 year olds who expect dialogue about emojis, insta and tik tok. The dumb ones that can only handle the most tired clichés like... boy who has inhaler is ""weak"" which you can tell is going to be a mis direct. Mother and Daughter don't see eye to eye but you know will make it up at the end. The mysterious killer who is definitely the next character introduced in the next scene. And I am only up to the sword fight in the first episode and hate it already.

First of all this show frames the Addams family as completely dysfunctional. The irony being that the original real Addams family (both the tv show and movies) were amazingly close and adoring of each other. That was the point. They were a weird creepy family but ironically the closest most loving family on the block. In this Wednesday show, Wednesday thinks Pugsley is weak and useless. She resents her mother and is completely indifferent to her father. Clearly the Addams Family is used in this situation to suck people in to watch. Not to extend and expand the legacy of a much loved idea.

This comes across as basically a scam. Using established material to shoehorn in a weak and lazy attempt at modern storytelling by writers with no integrity or skill. This just feels like a show on the level of iCarly or Wizards of Waverly place in its clearly predictable, safe, and unimaginably cliché and by the numbers narrative that (if I were a young girl) would find terribly offensive to my intelligence at how one dimensional the portrayal of a girls life is. And more insulting if you are a young boy watching where every male character is a bumbling idiot fool that needs a main character to make their life worthwhile.

This overall feels like they took Gilmore Girls and ran it through some algorithm computer system that dumbed it down and cheapened the show each time. And they would run the results through the algorithm like ten times to get it to this level of cheapness.  I mean I am now at the point in the first episode where Wednesday just beat up three large boys using kung fu.

The shame I have in my soul is that the idea... has potential. The opportunity was there. And just like always they chose the laziest easiest cut and paste elements and storylines from every ""meh"" show you have seen before. It is a show where you watch and you say to yourself... I have seen this all before. The storylines are all from stuff I have seen before... It is like when you watch a South Park episode and you KNOW they are parodying some movie scene or some cliche you have in the back of your mind but you can't quite put your finger on it.

[All] Just me or is Stanger Things very overrated?,"I thought it was a decent show but it wasn't the overwhelmingly amazing thing I expected from the reviews by many of my friends and family. It was not that creative. It was not that compelling. It blended together a bunch of 80's movies (which I get was the intention) but then instead of taking it in a new direction they just abused the nostalgia people got from it to get views. You can't just put together Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, Carrie, The Goonies, and E.T with a yellow-ish filter on it and expect me to think this show is a modern masterpiece because it gives me a rush of nostalgia. Nice try Netflix.

So for those of you who say it wasn't nostalgia driven, what made you like the show? Like I said I thought.it was good but what makes it THAT good? I didn't grow up in the 80's but I still get that nostalgia feeling bc my parents showed me them several times when I was young.

Why I am Quitting Netflix over Something Trivial After Years of Being a Loyal Customer [US],"I contacted Netflix about their auto-preview feature about a year ago on the Playstation 3. I hated it. I recently got a PS4. I also hate the auto-preview on the Playstation 4. They said back then that it was something they were testing. I, along with numerous other people (from what I gather online), have voiced their concerns as well.

I rented DVDs back in the day with Netflix and was an evangelist for the company. I brought them many customers during the early days because it seemed as if this was a company that understood its customers.

I contact them again today to complain about this bug. There is no option to turn off it.

""This is Norah, you are absolutely right it is not a feature, as it is the new preview for shows and movies we have now instead of the still image. I totally understand that you liked the old version better and I can send your feedback about it to my team.""

This is after the feedback I and many other people have sent. I think this bug is garbage.  You cannot even read the previews AND it shows 'you are interested in' type of suggestions for movies you have not even watched if you let it proceed for any duration of time.  If you look at any comments where this 'feature' is mentioned, it is full of hate for the inclusion of it.  I have no idea why there is no way to disable it.

Is anyone else completely frustrated by this? If so, please let them know. As for me, I am going to cancel my subscription after all of this time because nothing positive is happening with this. I might check back with them once every three months or so. There are other options, and perhaps other companies will listen to complaints.

And I know it is so trivial but this has been bothering me for so long. And it really is a bug not a feature.

Edit: Also, I complained about them not allowing people to sort by rating on the watched movies on their website.  Now, I must use IMDB for tracking my ratings for movies because the Netflix rating system is so poor.  It was once the easiest and best but they have taken away the features I once enjoyed.

And to this day, you can visit this article http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1437641682 to see people complaining about it.

Cancelled Netflix.. these are my reasons,"After many years of membership, I'm not cancelling due to cost but instead because:

* New shows / movies that I actually watch and enjoy (vs. just having Netflix on for background noise) have become few and far between with just a small number of episodes per season. I enjoyed Ozark, Stranger Things, Mindhunter, etc. but even for these great shows, it can take over a year for new seasons to be released which is far too long IMO (given that we're in the 2020s and not 1980s) and even when new seasons are released, there are only a handful (8-10) of episodes per season. Compare this to older shows like Seinfeld, produced 20+ years ago, that were able to release a new season every year with many more (20+) episodes each season -- and they did this without all the tech and increased efficiencies that producers have today. So for the shows that are actually worthwhile to watch and are well produced, it just seems like a long wait for literally a weekend's worth of episodes.
* The Netflix UI has IMO become more and more annoying and bloated over time. I can't stand the autoplay previews (I finally figured out how to turn this ""feature"" off) and also, I find myself manually searching (using the search feature) for shows that I want to resume watching as for whatever reason, they many times don't appear in my ""Continue Watching"" section (I think this is a sync issue between my 2 Roku TVs but I don't have time to troubleshoot it). But regardless, I think the UI from 5+ years ago was better, smarter, and less buggy than the UI today.

If I were Netflix, I would:

* Focus on quality over quantity -- producing 10 quality shows (with many episodes) to drive a large and dedicated user base is better than producing 100 shows that no one really cares about.. at least, not enough to keep paying a membership. IMO, nobody actually wants to pay for shows like ""Is it Cake?"".. shows like this are fine on free services but on a premium service? Really?
* For new shows and new seasons, I'd rethink the strategy of releasing an entire season of episodes all at once -- maybe release 2 episodes per week. Why? Because for example, I wanted to watch the new season of Dexter on Showtime so I subscribed to Showtime and watched all the episodes over a weekend. Then on the following Monday, I cancelled my membership. If Showtime had instead released 1 or 2 episodes per week, I would have kept my membership for several months (to watch all the episodes) and maybe during that time, found other shows on Showtime to watch and therefore, not cancel my membership. I do sometimes enjoy binging, so I'm not complaining about being able to binge and watch all the episodes of a new season when it's released -- I'm only saying that from a business standpoint, it may be a bad idea.
* Stop raising prices -- Netflix is no longer the king of streaming and IMO, should be lowering prices to remain competitive and to maintain and grow subscriptions. And no, lowering prices should not mean adding ads to shows but instead, Netflix should be able to lower its subscription prices by cutting costs by killing the many shows that are garbage (produced by Netflix and also, garbage licensed from other networks). Yes, ""garbage"" is subjective.. but if Netflix is bleeding members, there's a reason.. and that reason is not because there are ""too many"" great shows / movies on the service -- but instead, the reason is because members are finding fewer and fewer quality shows while at the same time, seeing the price of their subscription increase.

The math is really pretty simple: Fewer good shows + Higher costs = Cancelled subscriptions.",4,0.55,8,Anonymous_1011000,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1650490612.0,False,False,False,2022-04-20 21:36:52,after many years of membership im not cancelling due to cost but instead because new shows movies that i actually watch and enjoy vs just having netflix on for background noise have become few and far between with just a small number of episodes per season i enjoyed ozark stranger things mindhunter etc but even for these great shows it can take over a year for new seasons to be released which is far too long imo given that were in the s and not s and even when new seasons are released there are only a handful of episodes per season compare this to older shows like seinfeld produced years ago that were able to release a new season every year with many more episodes each season and they did this without all the tech and increased efficiencies that producers have today so for the shows that are actually worthwhile to watch and are well produced it just seems like a long wait for literally a weekends worth of episodes the netflix ui has imo become more and more annoying and bloated over time i cant stand the autoplay previews i finally figured out how to turn this feature off and also i find myself manually searching using the search feature for shows that i want to resume watching as for whatever reason they many times dont appear in my continue watching section i think this is a sync issue between my roku tvs but i dont have time to troubleshoot it but regardless i think the ui from years ago was better smarter and less buggy than the ui today if i were netflix i would focus on quality over quantity producing quality shows with many episodes to drive a large and dedicated user base is better than producing shows that no one really cares about at least not enough to keep paying a membership imo nobody actually wants to pay for shows like is it cake shows like this are fine on free services but on a premium service really for new shows and new seasons id rethink the strategy of releasing an entire season of episodes all at once maybe release episodes per week why because for example i wanted to watch the new season of dexter on showtime so i subscribed to showtime and watched all the episodes over a weekend then on the following monday i cancelled my membership if showtime had instead released or episodes per week i would have kept my membership for several months to watch all the episodes and maybe during that time found other shows on showtime to watch and therefore not cancel my membership i do sometimes enjoy binging so im not complaining about being able to binge and watch all the episodes of a new season when its released im only saying that from a business standpoint it may be a bad idea stop raising prices netflix is no longer the king of streaming and imo should be lowering prices to remain competitive and to maintain and grow subscriptions and no lowering prices should not mean adding ads to shows but instead netflix should be able to lower its subscription prices by cutting costs by killing the many shows that are garbage produced by netflix and also garbage licensed from other networks yes garbage is subjective but if netflix is bleeding members theres a reason and that reason is not because there are too many great shows movies on the service but instead the reason is because members are finding fewer and fewer quality shows while at the same time seeing the price of their subscription increase the math is really pretty simple fewer good shows higher costs cancelled subscriptions,cancelled netflix these are my reasons,0

I've seen some over the years complain they can't finish Netflix shows... I've lately started having his problem. Ozark and now I'm trying to decide if I should keep watching Glow. this was never an issue for me before.,"I liked season 1 of Ozark very much.  Then a certain character gets killed off and the show changed in season 2.  I didn't like start of season 2 and decided to give up i watched 2 or 3 episodes.  Seems like some of the main characters become so 1 dimensional I just didn't like it anymore. They made the blonde girl much more likeable and interesting but ruined most other characters by making them so one dimensional or giving them away less screen time.

I loved glow for 18 episodes.  I liked it better than Ozark season 1 it was so fun.  Then episode 19 the show changed drastically became a lot more positive vibes, no conflicts,  and in the start of season 3 seems like wrestling isn't even an important aspect of the show anymore.

Dear Netflix,"I’ve felt this way for a long time, but I couldn’t find the courage to leave until now. Being with you used to be so easy, but we both know it was never love. Sometimes you’re funny and sometimes you’re sweet, but your lack of commitment has ultimately caused our undoing. You’re never there for me. You tempt me into commitment just to leave me with an insatiable thirst for more, while you galavant off to another project, always leaving me feeling so unsatisfied and disjointed. 

You’ve treated my emotions like an American vandal, turning my heart as cold as an iron fist. I feel as though I’ve been a victim of a hit and run. I want to trust that you’ll come back, but years go by without a word, and then I scroll past just to find you with another show, (that you’ve undoubtedly promised the world to), and I just wish I could take that new project under my wing and tell it how much you’ve hurt me, and that there’s no future for the two of you. You’ll kick it to the curb like you have everything else we’ve shared together, just gone in 7 seconds. 

The countless hours spent on trying to recreate played out dramas, as if our time together meant nothing. You treat us like a poorly written reality tv show, and it hurts. Nobody wants that. I’ve tried to stay faithful, but I just can’t keep waiting around for you to break me heart over and over. I thought what we had was special, but now I need to prove to myself that I can glow again, one day at a time. 

I know right now everything sucks, but we’ll move on. I’m thinking of changing my life. Perhaps I’ll move west to Santa Clarita, diet, maybe joint a gym.

"I tried Netflix, I was disappointed! [ALL]","Hey, I live in Albania, a small country in southern Europe. I decided to try Netflix, and to be honest, even if it offered proper content I would not pay 12Euros per month. Although I'd never say no to a free month!

In Albania 90% of the population has smartphones (they are obsessed with them), 100% of the homes have a smart TV or a computer or an android box. But after browsing Netflix's library I was very disappointed. After I ducked about the different films and TV series I could find on it, I discovered Albania is the lowest ranking country for number of films and TV series. Every African or South East Asian nation has at least 2x-5x more films than we do. I finally understood why multiple friends have told me that Netflix isn't worth the money and time. My father and brother (Who are Italian, I am half Italian) were ecstatic about trying it, but they turned it off after watching 20 minutes of an American B-movie.

It seems odd considering that all paid TV subscriptions in Albania (e.g. DigitAlb) have a very rich library, with about 10 channels for each genre of film and 3 for series (but I hate Albanian subtitles and it's the reason why I never go to the cinema). Netflix would have had lots of success here, since people are still not very practical with the internet and torrents, and how easy it is to use it, and the availability on every possible device.

Conclusively I'd say that Netflix has a lot of work to do, at least in my country. Almost 80% of smart youngsters are fluent in English, so translators for the subtitles will never be a problem. Who knows, probably one day it will offer good content. (ATM there are 33 TV series and 200 films, 100 of which are Indian or Persian or Turkic, 80 are American b-movies and 20 are dumb blockbusters)

Meanwhile I'll finish the last two episodes of Black Mirror (I had forgotten about it's existence after finishing the 3rd season last year). And I'll keep watching films as I have always done, by downloading torrents. It's the only system that doesn't censor, the only one free and available to everyone, relatively simple and infinitely customizable.

If a Netflix employee or official is reading this review and thinking how they can solve these problems, I might help with translating the site, app and probably subtitles. If they also need advice on how to advertise Netflix to the Albanian public, I am available. I can also connect them with smart people that speak English, with considerable knowledge and experience in art or public relations. I'd personally be happy to work for Netflix for some time.

Sorry for the complains or the biased review. It's just the way it is :P I wish you all happy streaming and I really recommend watching Annihilation, a very spiritual and psychological film on subconscious and self awareness, told through sci-fi language. It's the trippiest film since Enter the Void!! :) Take care, Chris.

"Netflix is making a mistake by canceling shows, maybe. Are you like me?","I know people are different, but **if there are many people like me**, then Netflix is making a huge mistake by canceling shows the way it does. 

I pay for several streaming services, month after month for basically one reason.

**HBO**, I literally pay for this service every month so I can watch **South Park** (26 seasons) any time I want.  Because there are SO MANY episodes.

I pay for **HULU** every month so I can watch the HUGE library of Family Guy, American Dad, Bobs Burgers, etc... 

For me personally, the reason I give my money away is for access to shows I like that have many seasons. I like to binge watch the same stuff for a long time and then switch to something else. 

**I will pay for 26 seasons of South Park, but not one season of 26 different shows.**

The irony for me is that some of the best short term successes won't do well long term. Strangers things is great, I really liked it, but it gets old, and I don't see myself RE-WATCHING Stranger things for years and years, the way I do Always Sunny, Trailer Park Boys, Malcolm in the Middle and Modern Family.

If I never seen Breaking Bad, I might pay Netflix for a few months to watch it then cancel. I wouldn't continue paying every month to RE-WATCH Breaking Bad. It's the best show ever, but It's not really meant to be replayed.

I have seen Every episode of Big Mouth like 3 times, in the past few years, because it's a great show to put on in the background. For me, big Mouth is highly re-watchable. Big Mouth is not even close to the quality of Breaking Bad. But ''Breaking bad only gets like $20 out of my pocket''. Big Mouth contributes to me paying $100's over the years.

I know this is a long rant, but is anyone else like me? When they cancel Inside Job, I shake my head, because that's exactly the sort of show that I would pay for. Even Hoops, which wasn't great, was cancelled after One season. As Bad as Hoops was, I would rather pay for ten seasons of that than 1 season of 10 shows that get cancelled. 

Every time they cancel a show, they add another dead-end show to the list... a giant pile of unfinished stuff. I don't think people want to pay for a million dead-ends. Not only are they making a mistake by canceling it and not allowing it to develop into a multi season offering, they are making things worse by having so many unfinished shows.

Just Finished Midnight Mass. Very disappointed.,"I am probably going to get some heat for this post, but I really wanted to voice a few thoughts that nobody is really discussing regarding this show. If you liked this show, that's great. I just couldn't engage with it for the following reasons:

1. The monologuing is awful and completely unnecessary. The way a couple of the characters speak at each other in lengthy, convoluted speeches stopped the story dead in its tracks. As I was watching the scene where Riley Flynn and Erin Greene were talking about what they thought happens when they die, it felt like a really bad modern rendition of Hamlet's To Be or Not To Be speech. Also, Erin's final speech was a complete rip off of Alan Watts's lecture about death and the universe. 
2. Is this a universe that doesn't know what vampires are? If it walks like a vampire, sucks blood like a vampire, and dies in the sun like a vampire, then why don't we call it a vampire? It took Bella Swan a few minutes on google to figure out that Edward was a vampire, why not here? I didn't understand why no one was capable of using this word. It was annoying to watch them diagnose all the symptoms of a vampire infestation without actually being able to just say the word. 
3. It's predictable. The characters' behavior at times doesn't make any sense unless your leading your story to a very specific event or character reveal. When Bev Keene decides for absolutely no logical reason to torch all the buildings on the island but one, what else are we to expect to happen? Yes, I get that her character was supposed to be a fanatic, but she was introduced to us as manipulative, cunning, and sinister. The burning of the town didn't really fit her character nor serve any purpose other than the shows ultimate conclusion. 
4. The ""angel"" needed to be built up a bit more and given more to do. When the angel was nothing but a pair of eyes, I felt the terror when it took its victims. Then the creature was revealed in the desert scene, and it lost me. Watching it stalk and hunt a little bit more would have really built the anticipation before revealing the tall fleshy humanoid with wings. 

There were some redeemable qualities.

1. The acting was spot on. I hated Bev Keene which means Samantha Sloyan really brought it to this performance. Rahul Kohli and Hamish Linklater absolutely brought their A games as well. I was completely engaged in their characters and their performances. Everyone really did an amazing job on this show, and I can't fault any of the actors.
2. The show definitely draws from the work of Stephen King, in a good way, and admits it. In the very first episode, Ed Flynn is reading a Stephen King novel- an obvious shout out. I was really hooked the first episode or two.

The arrogance surrounding Don't Look Up,"It's actually possible to understand something and even support its message, and still think it is a poorly crafted piece of work. I'm tired of seeing ""if you didn't like this movie, the jokes are about you"" or ""you just didn't understand it"" all over social media.

I get that satire is meant to be over-exaggerated to a certain degree, but the movie failed to deliver on the key aspects of what makes GOOD satire. 

Yes, I did understand it. How could you not? That's actually a major problem with this movie: The satirical tools lacked subtlety and were too broad, obvious, repetitive and cheap. It never felt original or engaging, because the pre-digested points were continuously spoon-fed to me in a lazy, and ufortunately, a pretty un-funny manner. 

It usually doesn't take much for me to chuckle (especially in the presence of Jonah Hill), but the movie barely made me laugh. If you distill characters down to clichéd charicatures, they should be funnier and more cleverly written than what the movie managed to portray.

Does Blonde deserve the backlash it's getting?,"Full length video essay: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVplingzu4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVplingzu4)

Andrew Dominik’s new film Blonde has been divisive: the film has its defenders but there are a great many people who actively despise it. For some of Marilyn Monroe's fans creating a fictional story based on the life of a real person is tantamount to “lying”. Meanwhile some critics went as far as to suggest that Dominik was actively consumed by misogyny and that he made the film as a deliberate, conscious effort to hurt and punish Marilyn whom he apparently hates.

Blonde is not a biopic or a drama film in any conventional sense. It’s not a film that takes place in recognisable reality where we experience Marilyn Monroe as a three dimensional, multifaceted character who grows and changes over the course of a story like a normal protagonist.

Blonde is a nightmare, both one that Marilyn is having and one that we are having about her. The protagonist isn’t really Marilyn Monroe or even Norma Jean, the so-called “real woman” behind her; the protagonist is a fractured dream consciousness that lacks a stable sense of her own selfhood and desperately trying to cling on to some kind of connection.

So far the more I’ve thought about and rewatched the film the more textured and interesting it's become.

Netflix Originals leaving Netflix,"I was somewhat taken by surprise when the Netflix Marvel series were taken off Netflix recently. I had been under the impression that Netflix Originals would stay on the platform forever, but clearly that's not the case.

I'm not really surprised that 'co-productions' and 'exclusives' (made by or in conjunction with other networks) can end up getting removed from Netflix eventually. The category that caught my eye, though, is the shows that are 'solely distributed' by Netflix.

The OA,"Seriously, bring back the OA. Literally had no good reason to axe the show. Pathetic excuses for whatever weird reason you actually wanted it cancelled. And of course the incredible ""Netflix Originals"" title it has means no one else can get it. Greedy, money-hungry and power-starved, you won't give your viewers what they want. That's pretty much the only reason I have Netflix is in case it comes back. And Netflix is good for nothing else except old shit, sometimes a good original, and a few choice good shows.

"Netflix's response to more competition: Make the experience of watching the shows... WORSE! Aka. ""Watch the credits""","I get it! Netflix feels endangered because of the release of Disney+, so instead of actually trying to make the watching pleasure better, they decide to make it worse. Because... Don't care about the audience! Don't care about the whole ""watch content without interruptions"" philosophy! That is, if they ever has had the latter, because cutting the movie off when the end credits start surely just doesn't follow that philosophy.

Sure, I don't know the numbers but I could assume they cut them off because most viewers don't care about end credits (just go to the movies and see how many are leaving right after end credits start rolling). But then there are us who would willingly watch them, but the percent must be so low that Netflix rather ignore us than gives us the option to watch them without interruptions. Even in Netflix's own series' the music for the end credits aren't always the same from episode to episode and sometimes you just would like to listen to the song playing in the background without doing extra maneuvers to make that happen. Or just chilling out listening whatever music there is after the main show. Or for whatever reason.

The countdown was bad enough, but that you could turn off from the settings and after the countdown having to go to the small screen on the upper-left corner felt only a little nuisance. However, this ""click to watch credits"" business is making the pleasure of using Netflix worse. Not only the show is fully interrupted, you have to start the stream again just to find that it may take few seconds to get the show back on. Irritating, very irritating. At least with the small screen the stream wasn't discontinued.

Funnily enough, *The Irishman* hasn't been doing too good in the box offices but Netflix won't release exact numbers, because, according to news articles (and I don't know how recent comment this is), Netflix thinks there are more important factors than the numbers. like for example **viewing pleasure** but apparently that factor doesn't matter for their own service, not even for their own original series.

For now, so far I've watched tv shows only from Netflix (some movies from Amazon Prime), so I'm not sure how other streaming services are handling this (enlighten me, maybe?). When Disney+ is released in here (in two months or so), I'll get that immediately, but I was planning to keep Netflix along the side. But if I find out Disney+ handles this more customer friendly, I just might (no guarantees!) drop off from Netflix entirely and cancel my subscription with it, even if there are tons of tv series I would want to watch from there.

"[ALL] Very disappointed in Netflix. People are pirating not because they don't want to pay, they are pirating because they get a better experience from it","So I've been using Netflix for past 2 months. And generally, it's been quite bad experience.

I live in Georgia. Post soviet union, developing country. Netflix costs 9.99 Euro here, while it's 9.99 USD in US. No Netflix, $9.99 ≠ €9.99. I get half the content, for higher price. For example, steam games are at least 50% cheaper here, since it's a developing country. But I don't mind the price, it's just not justifiable.

Here are the few points based on my experience:

I'm a Linux user by default.

* Highest video quality I'm going to ever get is 720p, even if I pay for 1080p. **Torrenting** - I can get 1080p for free.
* Highest audio quality I'm going to get is **64 Kbps** **64**!!!. For comparison, Youtube is 256 Kbps. **Torrenting** - Source quality.

Then I thought - alright, I'm going to install Windows OS just for Netflix, space is cheap, it's fine. But no...

In Windows:

* If I ever want to get 1080p, I have to use this Windows 8 app. **Torrenting** - I can use whatever damn viewer I want.
* ""Highest video quality 1080p"" is 3000 Kbps-ish. **Torrenting** - 8000Kbps and up.
* I have to manually choose highest quality on each episode. Otherwise Netflix decides that my internet sucks (I have 100Mbps fiber) and it should stream 480p.
* Audio quality is better, but nowhere near real HD experience - 96 Kbps.
* Unless I'm going to spoof my location, I get 1/3 of content I'd get in US, while I'm paying more, based on GDP of my country and currency conversion.
* If you ever dare to minimize Netflix App window even for a sec, buffering starts all over again.

I just can't watch Orange Is The New Black anymore (Spoiler Alert!) Rant [ALL],"I really liked the first season, I really did. While I found the main characters Piper Chapman and Alex Vause a bit dull, the peripheral characters (especially Ms Claudette, who I easily found the most interesting character in the series--cou cou!) made the whole thing interesting.
However, by Season 2, the whole thing started fizzling down. I thought that Piper Chapman being in a maximum security prison for the whole season would have been interesting, but instead she's only there as part of the boring drama with Alex Vause, who I can't wait for to die in the series. Larry is gone by the end of the season, she has no more friends, no job prospects, essentially leaving her without anything interesting defining her except her relationship with Vause, which will continue to be the rest of the show(and I don't want to watch that).

Other things that irk me are former peripheral characters that were ghetto and thought that white people smelled funny suddenly knowing how to speak fluent German (as if!) and being in a committed relationship with a White German girl--Taystee having this mother figure named Vee who comes to dominate (and make boring) the whole second season. At least Rosa kills her in the end though, right?

I stopped watching the episode where Big Boo (who, leaving the Monsanto and other PC rants aside, also has the most unrealistic Come-to-Jesus moment in history with Pennsatucky about abortion on earth--I get it that the show creator is Jewish and probably hates Christians and their sometimes annoying way of approaching things, but *come on*, the relentlessness of it has all of the subtlety of a cloying PSA) attacks a man for calling her a dyke. I literally stopped watching right there. I get enough politically correct propaganda in everything else as is, and the idea of some fat ass dyke being able to scare a man is just ridiculous as the premise that anyone would find such an obese slob attractive. The whole show's flashbacks are mostly stupid as they seem a bit retconned.
I literally cringe when the Alex Vause flashbacks dominate an episode. I skip all the parts with Alex Vause and Piper Chapman.

I'm cancelling my subscription.,"Netflix is nothing but old movies and shows everyone has already seen. They come up with these amazing original shows and then cancel them with no warning after the second or third season on a cliff hanger. Then again they come up and release absolute shit original movies. I'm not paying for old material and I'm not paying for half assed material. Netflix used to be awesome.

&#x200B;

Now it's a fucking joke.

&#x200B;

Everything that was good about Netflix has been cancelled. All the best shows. Everything I've been looking forward to. All cancelled. As such? I don't need to pay for this subscription any more and all of you should also reconsider. Everything you can find on Netflix that is not original? You can find for free on a smart Tv or through roku or a fire stick. There is only one thing currently, left on netflix that I am excited about. The prequel to the dark crystal, but they are making it a show and will most likely cancel it as soon as they air it SO WHY AM I WASTING MY MONEY?

&#x200B;

I miss when Netflix was good. I'm angry that Netflix cancels shows in the middle of a serious story with no explanation or even atleast a movie to explain. There is really nothing on Netflix that I want to watch that I have not already seen. Yet I'm paying a monthly fee for the possibility they MIGHT air something I'm interested in. When they have literally cancelled any actual good material they had going for them.

&#x200B;

I'm done and this is goodbye and I know no one cares. I just hope someone from Netflix sees this, in combination with everyone else who is leaving and maybe they will realize what a shit entertainment model they have installed. Maybe they will listen to fans, instead of the people who hand out Movie awards.

&#x200B;

It sucks and this makes me sad. For the record what I was spending on Netflix is now going to Starz. SO far I do not regret the decision.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else feel disappointed with content Netflix wide this year? In a really general sense?,"I don't have an issue with the originals they have released, however I feel like 2019 and 2018 had some really incredible shows and movies. 
I remember multiple times where I would wake up every day, really excited to see if there was something new and interesting on, and there was! Almost a weekly basis at times something great, or at least entertaining/exiting, would come out once a week or bi-weekly. 

TV is my vice, I really enjoy a great TV show. I felt the Netflix subscription was worth every penny. 
This year however, the price went up and I feel like there have been entire months where nothing interesting came out. 
On top of that, a few of my favorite shows got discontinued. I have some Netflix Original animes I am scared to look up in fear I find they have been cancelled too. 
I have watched a lot of foreign/international shows and movies to make up for it, maybe in genres that werent my first choice. I don't wish to complain, as I appreciate these shows a lot and they've fulfilled my cravings for good TV. However I miss when it was back to back scifi releases, and the writing quality was really high. Lots of low quality dubs. 

They've done some cool stuff with zombies this year. 
Idk. So many short seasons. 
I'm worried now they'll cancel Kingdom too, which is my favorite show right now that's still actually running. It's crazy that they are making so many subscribers anxious. It feels like the only sure thing is another season of Ozark.

"As someone who didn't like the second half of the Daredevil season 2 and 3, I loved Punisher season 2 and I am glad they got their strides back","Punisher did everything Daredevil season 3 and to some extent, Luke Cage season 2 failed to do. Create an antagonist, make them sympathetic and then DON'T treat them like shitbags that the hero beats up to save some infinitely worse baddie.

&#x200B;

For Luke Cage it was Bushmaster. Luke becomes Mariahs lacky, where he goes from fighting alongside Bushmaster to take out some baddies, establishing some level of respect between the two to straight up nearly killing him, in order to keep Mariah safe. Luke keeping Mariah safe from another baddie was the definition of the season.

&#x200B;

Daredevil does something similar, although Bullseye wasn't as sympathetic as Bushmaster was IMO, especially after he killed all those innocent people, but you could see where the writer was going, especially with the girl. But throughout the season and the show really, Daredevil is slowly coming to the realization that throwing people in jail, only allows them to become even more powerful and hurt more people. So he turns Bullseye by revealing what happened to his girl, gets him into position to take out Kingpin, then not only does he continuously foil his attempts to kill Kingpin and his lady friend, who at this point was a ruthless criminal, both of whom were trying to make Matt and Co's life miserable, but immobilizes Bullseye and shakes fucking Kingpins hand. And the whole cycle repeats itself.

&#x200B;

Could you imagine if Punisher shook hands with Billy after all the stunt he pulled during and before the show? Nah, he recognized Billy was a shit bag and he deserves no sympathy. John on the other hand was an interesting take, you could definitely see where he was coming from and he had things to lose, if he didn't do what his 'handlers' told him to do. But he killed a lot of innocent people. So the only right thing to do was, let Punisher wail on him, see why he's doing what he's  doing and you know what, let him live so he can go take care of his children, in an imperfect world, that is an imperfect solution. That also shows the kind of guy Punisher is. Not go through hell to ensure his handlers go to jail or some BS.

&#x200B;

Now i get Punisher is different to Luke and Daredevil personality and principle wise, Punisher having no issues with killing. But his actions are the more reasonable of the trio and something that reflects quality writing.

&#x200B;

I really hope they don't cancel this show, cause I couldn't really care less Daredevil got canned (kinda sad Luke Cage got canned).

How do you like Netflix given their business model?,"From a recent WSJ article:

Their goal is to have customers click on a show in the first 10 seconds on Netflix—called “the moment of truth” inside the company. “If they decide not to watch something, that’s a moment we lost,” one engineer said.

Why do people like Netflix?  Everything about this company seems so shitty from their cult like working environment to the way in which they mine data to determine what content to produce.  Even their user interface is built around recommending content to the point that they actively make it difficult to just browse. 

Furthermore,  over 3/4 of their content contains product placement....The model they've replaced is not without faults but this model seems to solely be designed to churn out content based solely in what their algorithms determine you want to see and then infuse that with marketing and product placement to drive more revenue. 

In other words we've inverted the role of the artist and the audience. Before an artist (movie maker) creates something and the audience reacts. Now we determine how the audience is going to react and then give them what they want. Seems pretty messed up. Are you conscious of this?  Not care?  Disagree with this characterization?

Lost in Space.......ok/facepalm,"Ok I think the series is good so far. Netflix has done their magic thing again. But a few very notable issues 2 episodes in.

1) why is Dr Smith written/portrayed so poorly? Why are we given this woman with literally zero motivation for acting like a total creeper for no other reason than acting like a creeper?

I mean ok. Dr Smith steals her sisters ID. Puts dude through airlock cos he knows she isn’t who she says. She totally has a chance for a new life on the planet but takes literally every oppportunity to creep.....when there is no threat or need for it anymore. 

God I literally can’t stand the character. It’s like a lazy addition to just make “trouble” for no reason. 

2) why is one of the Robinson family kids black/mixed when clearly neither parent are????
Is Netflix going for rainbow agenda again? I mean personally I don’t care but when things stand out as obviously not making sense for the sake of silly agendas it’s weird.

I’ve only watched one episode, and already we’ve had:

Comments about fighting the patriarchy (from the main character)

Comments about misogyny. (for the villain)

A girl who looks like a guy getting bullied. 

Comments about a culture of masculinity (amazed no one said “toxic”, although that was the obvious subtext.)

Talk about “allies” and the need for “safety”

A boyfriend who nods in agreement to all of this.

Bonus points for a gay male confidant.

Porn Glitch I think?,"The most bizarre thing happened just now while my fiancé and are bingeing Seinfeld on Netflix… when the last episode we watched of Seinfeld ended a new show entirely started playing automatically. It was titled “I Fucked her Finally” or something like that and then a sex scene showing two girls blowing a guy started playing. This was full blown porn on Netflix where you could see everything, penis and all. We were both horrified and exited out of the porn right away. I tried looking up the show or this glitch and nothing has popped up… am I missing something here? I’m so confused as to what just happened and honestly mad because there could be kids around when a glitch like this happens…. Does anyone have an experience like this with Netflix?

Edit to add more detail: We are on season 5 and we watched Episode 3, 4, 5, and 6 tonight and after episode 6 is when this other porn movie started playing on Netflix.

2 seasons and cancelled,"I’m sure many of you have noticed that it’s very common for Netflix to pump out 1, usually 2, and sometimes 3 seasons of a show and then cancel it. Never to be heard of again. Unfinished plot lines and building fan bases just to cancel the show for a new one.
I understand there’s an algorithm to determine the success rate of a show vs the profitability; however, it appears Netflix has an obsession with NEW subscribers. They willingly push their loyal and long subscribers to the side for the opportunity to gain more followers. They essentially know we are not cancelling our subscriptions and likely are not going to even when they cancel so many of our favorite shows just to promote newer cheaper ones in a hope it will gain trending popularity and that people will subscribe specifically for said show.
I would love for just one week in solidarity if those of us who have had several shows make it to the Netflix graveyard at the hand of Netflix would cancel our Netflix account (when it asks why- write it in) and hit them where it hurts. Netflix will NOT bring back these shows (nor allow other networks to pick up their cancellations) and it’s the greed and disloyalty for me…..

Is anyone worried about polarised streaming services?,"I am worried about polarised streaming services.

What do I mean by that? We know that politics has become more polarised, 'comedy' has become more polarised, and entertainment certainly has. I have seen a lot of content that hates men and hates people of Europian decent. I have found it to be trying to say the least.

I am worried with Disney coming into the fray, that we going to see the start of polarised content. I don't think that is good for anyone who isn't far right or left. See I like Wolverine chomping a cigar, I like Queer Eye talking to Trump supporters and hugging it out, and I like Marvel series and their darker tones.

"""Dear White People"" is perfect. [USA]","I saw the film a while ago and thought highly of it, but the Netflix series Dear White People goes way beyond what the film accomplished.  It's rare when a show can do everything, but this one does.  It is:

a) Consistently funny.  

b) Consistently insightful.

c) Consistently dramatically brilliant.

d) Consistently credible, with well-acted and sympathetic characters.

At no point did I find anything wrong with it.  When it's serious, it's sincerely so - not sanctimonious or self-righteous.  When it's funny, it's *damn* funny, and sometimes hilarious.

It's a perfect show, and difficult to resist binging.

How long would Lost last if made on Netflix in 2023?,"I honestly don't think it'd get 3 seasons, maybe 2 at a push, then it'd get a cult following like Sense8 or 1899. I know Dark did reasonably well but that had 3 seasons too.

If rates increase again.,"Dear Netflix,

If you feel the need to raise our rates again based on content and all that jazz. Please add the feature to be able to ignore entire genres! The ability to completely ignore genres would be satisfactory to me and I am sure other people as well.  The way I see it, I wont have to see all those stupid romance reality tv shows, bollywood nonsense, xmas garbage, kids stuff, korean shows, etc.. There are so many things I have no interest in yet they continue to shove them in my face every time I go there. Please you're just as bad as a cable company that claims they cannot give you a single station over another. You get those 17 sports channels and not the science channel and comedy channel you wanted. Unless you paid $50 more a month.  If you claim your thumbs up and down system is the cause or has something to do with it. You provided 2 ways to say you like or love this thing. Why not give us 2 ways of saying dislike or hate it?

We are paying a premium price for a service that is getting less premium each year. No wonder you lost so many subscribers recently. Maybe you should listen to your subscribers more? So instead of attacking account sharing and people who actually enjoy their use of this streaming platform, why not ask us what don't like instead of what we like.  We are paying you, get over the fact that not everyone wants to pay for an account and others will share what they have. It's a barter system, I let you use my netflix and you give me access to your streaming service. It's not the end of the world. Keep this up and you'll end up worse off then blockbuster.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

Me.

"So, i watched Cowboy Bebop anime after i watched the adaptation.","I did not like it that much. Kinda.  
So, a disclaimer: i am not an anime watcher. I like Castlevania and that's pretty much it. That means, i don't know shit. I still have an opinion. My previos post is this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/r1f7c1/i\_quite\_enjoyed\_cowboy\_bebop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/r1f7c1/i_quite_enjoyed_cowboy_bebop/)

Compared to the show, to any show nowadays really, it's a bit hard to watch. The once-a-week concept is very visible and there are even a commercial cuts. They are kind of useful though. But still, you get thrown into many kinds of action before you get to warm up to the characters. 

The characters. Everybody is a major dick a lot of the times. 

Spike is still likable, he's funny and endearingly annoying. Like a class-clown with a darker past. The whole Syndicate part of his past i still don't like. Here it flashed out in less words and his love to Julia is even more confusing. I get the emotion, i do. Maybe i am the unloving weirdo, but i would prefer angry Julia to dead Julia. More suffering in the show! Yeah! I would like to see the two more as a team, though, before they fully become enemies. Julia in the show is still amusing to me, because she's supposed to be Russian or of Russian descent. It's still super sudden.

Jet is a dad. In the anime he's an unspoken dad of the whole crew, in the show he's a double dad. I enjoyed him going outside of Bebop and partnership with Spike, i think we might get more of that in the show. He is fine, he's perfectly human. I like the episode where he had to help the daughter of Pao, the old Syndicate informant. 

Faye is less likable than in the show. I get why she is the way she is, she reminded me greatly of player 212 from Squid Game. Yeah, i know. I mean ""Smart without money"" kind of character. She did survive long enough, even considering the gambling addiction. She resents any atachments and refuses to accept them. I like the show Faye more now. And oh my god, the outfit. I am so thankful the only thing that migrated to the show is the top. I can't with the sexualization. Also, Whitney storyline in the anime just took me out. So funny. The mom-version is good too. 

I am actually excited for Ed now. She's cool! And probably will have pretty strong connection with Spike in the show. I am glad Ein is with her from the start of her run. I don't see much wrong with the adaptation version of Ed. It's been like 10 seconds of her. If the kid is casted right, it will be a great thing. In the terms of great child casting for weird-ish roles, i'm thinking about a Barry episode, with a demonic karate child.

Gren and Annie. I do appreciate them more. I am glad that in the show Gren is non-binary just because, with no apparent reason like drug addiction. They didn't seem so upset about it in the anime, but still. I would like to see show-Gren to be more homicidal. Annie is a tiny-bity character compared to the show. I adore the change of scenery. I am glad she's not dead in the show, but i am starting to think she might die. 

There was a lot of concepts i want to see in the show. And now i kind of understand what went wrong with Poirott. I don't think he was spoiled, but his introduction went a bit sideways. You see him as crazy in the show, when in anime he's really particular kind of crazy - homicidal child. That's why Spike defeating him in the show felt weird. I desperately want to see the undying child in the show. In any capacity. Just that creepy vibe made me watch more.

Lastly, the finale. If you love Spike, in the show he gets to live longer. I know he's different there, but come one, the man has the physique of Jack Skellington's and coat hanger's love child. John Cho is great. I've read his interview about the age gap, and i don't think he's wrong about his version of the character being loving and vulnerable, and the fact that he's more able to show it at his age. And come on, the man is trying, he tore an ACL during shooting. Stop being pissy. 

The show is NOT a crime against anime. It's great. The anime is great too. I watched it subbed, and i don't know how i did not notice that the dubb was there. But i like both a considerable amount. It's a different amount to each of them, but still. The show is great and works almost all of the time, beside some weird choices. The anime is great, it holds up good enough, and i think now more people will watch it and appreciate it.

I feel like netflix is slowly losing its value over time,"Back in 2011 or so, netflix was easily the thing to have. A lot of popular shows were readily available and it was easily better than hulu.

But after some time, I'm starting to realize that netflix is taking out a lot of shows that I like and mostly replacing them with orignials. I find most netflix originals to be atrocious, the best one is stranger things, but nothing else comes close to it. Its clear that they can't really hold on or renew the contracts they have with the companies that own those different shows, and its annoying how they're trying to bring back old humor/shows (bill nye/seinfeld/gilmore girls/fuller house etc). Why is it like this? Why do the netflix originals have such a huge gap in quality like this?

Hulu on the other hand has shows that I want to watch. South park, always sunny, seinfeld, scrubs, etc. And thats another thing, for comedies, netflix mixes stand ups with comedy shows. That's not how it works netflix, separate the two. 

I'm also an anime fan, and hulu has more episodes than netflix for shows like naruto, bleach, and other shows like fullmetal, my hero academia, etc. 

Its furstrating because I want bang for my buck, but hulu has ads, which is annoying. 

So how does disney buying fox work now? Cause I know netflix has a deal with disney to show its movies including star wars, marvel, etc. but when that deal expires, will it renew?

Pinocchio isn’t a good choice if you or your kids are sensitive to sad movies,"Yesterday (Christmas morning) my family decided to watch Pinocchio after breakfast. I saw that it was rated PG so I figured there wouldn’t be anything in it that would upset the kids. I was WRONG.

Thank you for listening Netflix,"Between a mountain of bad that gets posted, myself included, I wanted to write an appreciation post.

2 months ago I made a complaint that Netflix doesn't let you know when shows and movies on your list are going away. This made it really awkward to use Netflix to keep track of things you would want to watch and forced you to use something like Letterbox alongside it. There were people attacking me for that logic as this was apparently a bad move for Netflix to do and gives the costumer less incentive to stay subscribed to the service.

I think this might be the leading reasons for Netflix financial woes...,"They keep cancelling shows that have a following.  I mean why would anyone really invest in a Netflix series when the standard there is a whopping 3 seasons for the most part?    


I just found out that Last Chance U both football and B-ball have been cancelled for some time now...I looked up if there was going to be new seasons since Covid seems to be fading and restrictions lifting...but got a cold splash of water that its over...  


I don't understand Netflix.  I was really loving Lost in Space...nixxed after season 3.  They didn't even fight for their shows, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Punisher at all...just handed that over to Disney to be mangled to death.   


Recently watched all of Last Kingdom...was freakin great...only to be nixxed to be made into movies or some shit?   


American Vandal...stupid but largely entertainingly funny...nixxed yet Big Mouth continues on and I would put the two comedies in the same boat of raunchiness.   


Santa Clara Diet...good fun.   


Chilling Adventures of Sabrina...seemed to have a good following even though I never watched it yet.   


Patriot Act with Hasan...entertaining enough...biased but I don't think they tried to pass themselves off as nonbiased.  


Altered Carbon.

Netflix needs to lean heavily into only doing movies and limited series to save their reputation.,"I, as a pragmatic individual, once defended Netflix tendency to cancel shows, even those that had both great audience and critics scores. Understanding that they simply had to cancel them because they did not have the views or the ability to bring in new subscribers.

But now the streaming services is a mess of unfinished projects cluttering its library.

If Netflix simply can not promise to complete these long-winded series, then they should swear them off for the time being and focus on making films and limited series that have no promise of a sequel or another season. And frankly I think that would suit them quite well.

&#x200B;

Limited series are great succinct stories that, unlike films, have enough runtime to create good characters and world building. Enough to create a good story that has a well-rounded beginning, middle and end.

&#x200B;

Why does Netflix keep Fireflying shows?,"I know this is not a new observation but I'm so frustrated with Netflix abruptly canceling shows that I get really into ( Tuca & Birdie, the Irregulars, the Get Down, etc) and seem to get good critical reviews and would've almost certainly garnered larger audiences if they'd been allowed to grow across multiple seasons. Recently with the irregulars, it had charted on the top 10 and was not particularly well marketed either. It had huge potential and i really hope it gets picked up somewhere else but that seems unlikely. 

Again, not a new sentiment, but it makes me really hesitant to start anything new since they're on an axing spree. I get that the pandemic has made filming hard but netflix has been doing pretty well financially and I find it hard to believe that starting up a whole bunch of shows just to kill them is more cost effective than extending existing ones.

"In light of the recent Netflix cancellations, should Netflix obey what customers want to be considered a valuable streaming service?","I ask this because Netflix has let a lot of customers disappointed this year with the huge streak of cancellations they've been doing, either because some of their shows don't make a lot of money or don't get a big audience, or due to the Coronavirus, providing uncertainty to production companies that want to return to their labors as usual. Also, for some customers, it feels like Netflix is cancelling more shows than the average Cable TV network, even though it's way less than that.  But what bothers me about the people on reddit, or online forums, is that they think Netflix owes us a lot for canceling their shows, and they have to please us if they want to succeed. We've seen dozens of written articles and videos that have informed us why Netflix cancels their originals when they're not the expected successes, and yet there's a lot of people on the internet who won't shut up about the service is betraying customer's trust by cancelling shows they like, and how they have to finish their shows if they want to earn customers back again. But we need to get some things clear for these discussions:

* Netflix is not a charity company. TV Networks are not a charity company either. They're in all their rights to cancel any series if it's not pulling in their desired amount of audience they need to justify the costs of their shows. If it's a show with great critical reception, and it's also an unconventional show that breaks molds and delivers better content than expected, but it's audience is a very niche group of people that you can count with one hand, it means the show doesn't work for the production company, and they have to cancel it. AS much as Netlfix users coment online about how much they loved The OA and Santa Clarita Diet, if there was little audience watching these shows when they started, and less than that in subsequent seasons, they deserve to be cancelled, much to your dismay. It's the same as if you open a grocery store but the only people buying products in there are 20 every day instead of 200 customers that you expect to see per day. 
* Not all the shows share the same demographics,and this is an important factor for TV production companies. Some shows are exclusively liked by sci-fi nerds, other s by prestige TV fans, others by period pieces lovers, etc. Some shows are able to reach more than one group of audience, and these are the ones the big TV production companies value the most, which is why you see Netflix creating so many shows in the hope they get a big hit, like with Stranger Things and The Witcher, shows capable of pulling in more than one exclusive demographic. We also have  to take into account that depending on the specific demographic, these groups have a set number of fans, but the big companies need a bigger number of people from that demographic to sustain the shows. For example, as much as sci-fi nerds loved The OA, Netflix expected a bigger audience than just 5000 sci-fi nerds from the whole world who watched the first season to justify the expenses on that show.
* The people on reddit or internet forums are pissed off about Netflix targeting critically well received shows for their cancellations, while internet people ask ""why don't they cancel their garbage shows like Another Life, or The Ranch, or Paradise PD? They should know nobody watches that garbage"", but the internet people don't know which audience actually watches these shows enough to keep them alive, and given than these shows pull off more than one target demographic around the world, they're successful by the company's metrics, so they will only be cancelled when necessary. The fact that the garbage shows are kept alive doesn't mean that the company is doing a disservice to its customers, because what you like is not what the average, mainstream audience doesn't like. And this is another thing we have to take into account: The mainstream audience doesn't like complicated shows that take a lot of effort and attention span to understand. They don't like prestige shows that send them to sleep. They like shows that entertain them, regardless of quality. Would you like your grandpa to just watch cool HBO shows just because they're prestige and great TV, even though your grandpa hates these shows?

My question is why online users don't shut up about these posts that overwhelm Reddit and other online forums, despite the plethora of clarifications and information provided? The discussions about users hating Netflix cancellations should dissapear by now, or maybe the online forum people should do a strike against Netflix cancellations in whichever way they want. With a strike maybe the company reconsiders the idea of reviving some shows, and even then the company will not do what you want because they will still care about what's

Maybe they could do something like playing only critically-acclaimed movies on mondays to attract a more respectful movie going audience (Marriage Story, Roma, The Two Popes) and more blockbuster type things on fridays (Stranger Things season finales, black mirror)

Chainsmoking Netflix [ALL],"I just watched a short while back Polar, I watched Bandersnatch, and I saw a bit of Russian Doll.

Anyone care to postulate any particular reason that all these characters smoke so much?

Netflix taking some tobacco money for product placement? What gives?

I am a non-smoker. (Surprise!) I don't like the way it smells. (Surprise again! Got you!) It conjures up memories of being a kid in the car and that shitty stink I can't get away from.

Also, I can't get away from the odor my vivid imagination tells me that the actress in Russian Doll probably has. ...That person that walks on the elevator and just reeks of the habit.

What's up?

Is geoblocking still proffitable? Why companies keep restricting access on Netflix and alike? [ALL],"So, Netflix expanded worldwide and I signed up that same day. But soon I felt it all underwhelming..
Two reasons. First - i don't like user interface. More on that later. And secondly - media catalog is just so awful in my country (Lithuania). I like documentaries. So I checked documentary section - it's not more than 50... I logged via VPN into US version - and i gave up before i could scroll to find the end. Difference couldn't be more stark. And it's not just for documentaries - movies, tv shows, you name it. 90% of what i wanted to watch is not on Netflix. Btw, i couldnt stream many from US version either, so it's a worldwide problem, not just foreign.
Which brings me to the question - why media companies even do it? How can it possibly be profitable to withhold rights to stream video, especially with illegal content so accessible. Hell, even here in Lithuania, people subscribe to Netflix like illegal options. People pay to see movies, not realizing they are pirated... What line of thinking makes media execs think that's a solution to anything? Or are they simply too entrenched in their thinking, too slow to adapt, or to weak to change anything and just swim by the tide? Could anybody help me understand their thinking?
And side question. Does anyone find Netflix user interface bad? I'm very used to youtube. It's very clear, responsive. On netflix, however, everything seems to be in the way of me. I can't find the movies, suggestions are all off. I can't easily come back to watching movie, if I haven't bookmarked it in my list. If i rewind, I have to wait for buffering again.

Serious Inquiry about Propaganda on Netflix,"So I am coming to reddit with a question- has anyone else picked up on U.S. pentagon style propaganda getting pushed by netflix?

However I have noticed netflix has recently been pushing a few content materials that seem clear as day to be pro military propaganda. I am specifically referencing ""6 underground"" and ""messiah""  


""6 underground""- is revolving around the chemical gas attacks in syria in 2017. the chore essence of the movie is a billionaire who is doing the things in the middle east that need to be done to ensure our peace that nation states are too scared to do themselves. movie even features a radicalized soldier who has seen this government shortcoming firsthand. there is a lot more, but that is just to name a few things i picked up on in the movie.  


""messiah"" begins in the near future. after the US pulls out of the middle east in 2019, ISIL regains strength and takes over the region. First episode goes on the inforce to core values of truth and freedom at the cia.   


again there is a lot more there, i am being brief. but i have been thinking about this for a few weeks and I have to say it feels like this is being pushed (front page of netflix, all over national netflix billboards) to prepare us for something... idk say these tensions that also just happen to be flaring up with Iran at the same time...

Umbrella Academy is just a mess.,"If you haven't seen it, let me save you the bother and offer a spoiler-free synopsis of how it's built:

Take a poorly-written ripoff of The Royal Tenenbaums, mash it together with a painfully self-conscious variation of X-Men, and build it from characters that are mostly boring and try to substitute phony ""edginess"" for personality.

Now use these placeholder characters to make a bunch of disjointed scenes as if they had nothing to do with each other, but try to offset the weakness in the script with soundtracks designed to impress you with Netflix's ability to **license expensive music** rather than building the right atmosphere.

Scotch-tape these scenes together with minimal connective tissue, making a whole that is far less than the sum of its parts, and then shriek into everybody's ear that they are *supposed* to like it.

"Did anyone else hate ""Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes""?","I'm watching this show right now and cannot believe how boring it is.

It's a 4-part documentary series on one of the most infamous serial killers of all time, but watching it feels like homework. Of the true crime docu-series that Netflix has put out, this one has got to be the worst one I've watched (with Making a Murderer, the Keepers and Evil Genius being some of the best.)

The Bundy Series has the most boring narrative structure of any docu-series I've seen on Netflix. There are absolutely no twists or turns. It's just ""this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened"".

Also, my god, I hate the journalist interviewing Ted Bundy. This guy comes off as so smug to me. He's unable to get Ted to open up about any of the crimes he's been convicted of so he comes up with this idea to have him talk in the third person. It's like Bundy's version of OJ Simpson's ""If I Did It"". And you know what, it is a success in terms of getting Ted Bundy to actually talk about the crimes, but the journalist just takes everything he says at face value? This man who we've established is not only a serial killer, but a compulsive liar?

And I cannot stand to hear any of the people who had direct contact with Bundy speak. His lawyers, the detective and the journalist all have this... I don't know what to call it... pride doesn't feel like the right word, but they all seem very pleased with themselves. They really seem to be relishing their time in the limelight, which they only have because of a murderer.

I don't know... this whole series just feels weak to me. I'm only on episode 2, so maybe it gets better, but as of right now it's slow as hell and barely interesting at all. Does anyone else feel the same way? Everyone else I know that's watching it seems to be loving it, but I've been nothing but disappointed by the whole series.",5,0.55,25,Pollock95,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1548894280.0,False,False,False,2019-01-31 00:24:40,im watching this show right now and cannot believe how boring it is its a part documentary series on one of the most infamous serial killers of all time but watching it feels like homework of the true crime docuseries that netflix has put out this one has got to be the worst one ive watched with making a murderer the keepers and evil genius being some of the best the bundy series has the most boring narrative structure of any docuseries ive seen on netflix there are absolutely no twists or turns its just this happened and then this happened and then this happened also my god i hate the journalist interviewing ted bundy this guy comes off as so smug to me hes unable to get ted to open up about any of the crimes hes been convicted of so he comes up with this idea to have him talk in the third person its like bundys version of oj simpsons if i did it and you know what it is a success in terms of getting ted bundy to actually talk about the crimes but the journalist just takes everything he says at face value this man who weve established is not only a serial killer but a compulsive liar and i cannot stand to hear any of the people who had direct contact with bundy speak his lawyers the detective and the journalist all have this i dont know what to call it pride doesnt feel like the right word but they all seem very pleased with themselves they really seem to be relishing their time in the limelight which they only have because of a murderer i dont know this whole series just feels weak to me im only on episode so maybe it gets better but as of right now its slow as hell and barely interesting at all does anyone else feel the same way everyone else i know thats watching it seems to be loving it but ive been nothing but disappointed by the whole series,did anyone else hate conversations with a killer the ted bundy tapes,0
i am one episode in black mirror and it entirely lost what made it great (spoilers),"black mirror has always been about the future of technology dystopian, but joan is awful makes no sense, it's like that star trek episode but nothing tells the viewer whats happening, black mirror is about a world that doesn't exist and likely never will it takes inspiration from real life but never copies it, but this episode is about technology we have today such as quantum computing and deepfake, i think they got too confident, then again i am just on episode 1 so maybe it gets better.

Why I am cancelling my subscription,"So first of all I think that Netflix used to be the most sexy thing for people who enjoy movies and binge series. Before we had streaming we had illegal websites with shitty quality and a bunch of ads. Not really good for the industry and bad user experience. It was the best alternative to buying the movie online for the DVD price or actually buying the DVD and having a huge collection of which half of them would be watched once or twice.

First time I got Netflix it was worth the money. Access to series with subtitles, great movies selection and great quality. I thought that it can only get better from here.

Fast forward a few years and I turn on the app and I have came to a few realization:  
\-The streaming market sucks because in order to watch what I want I have to make several subscriptions  or miss out. 

\-Library is region locked and fairly small. Not a lot of movies from the 90s or 00s. Not a lot of classic blockbuster movies available.

\-Netflix originals are mediocre. Some good but I have a feeling that they are making content for the sake of making content.

\-I love Vox and their explained series but their quality has been dropping and it feels like a celebrity is reading out a wikipedia article with visual effects. Documentaries in general are becoming pretty lackluster since they feel very superficial and do not cover the topic completely.  Ken Burns documentary on prohibition and the Vietnam war documentary were pretty solid tho. 

\-Series being produced are still released on a weekly basis which I find very frustrating since this is not TV where I should have to wait. 2022 bro we binge nowadays. I understand why companies do this for the life cycle and franchising etc. however I still do not like it.

Tldr: I feel like Netflix has become lazy and not worth the money anymore. The reason why I subscribed in the first place have become obsolete. Netflix has become lazy and the quality of new releases are mediocre or bad.

Glass Onion is vastly overrated [Spoilers],"Hmm am I really the only one who thought this movie is overrated?

So it is a ""whodunnit"" movie, but it is so anti-climatic when the bad guy is revealed. Wow, it turned out that the guy who was set up to be the villain was... the villain. never any real ""aha""-moments. Besides, the first murder happens so late in the movie and the revelation relatively soon afterwards that there is not really time to sit as the viewer and figure out who actually did it. And the time you do get to think about it everything points to Nortons character anyway, so again no big revelation.

EVERYTHING WRONG WITH LOST IN SPACE (NETFLIX),"I agree with first comment I saw, LIS is totally not popcorn worthy, some chief exec shoulda pulled it and totally re edited the first season. Episode one should be buried somewhere in season twenty two, anywhere once the audience is invested in the characters, love or hate. Ep 1, no context first scene, unknown astronaughts, on hostile planet (we don’t know they could breath), spaceship gone, with nothing but themselves in spacesuits... thats the time to take the cyinide capsules. So they survive by dumb luck, four times, four events a trillion to one against, ok air, Judy freeze, Will survive fall save robot, robot save family.

Audience can suspend disbelief to accept an impossible science eg warp drive, BUT having accepted the impossible creation, the things that happen have to be plausible. For fiction: A plausible impossibility is better than an implausible possibility.

THAT IS; writers make up any bullshit they like, just don’t ask us to believe the character have to win the lottery twenty times in a row for the plot to work

My Pitch to Netflix [meta],"So I wasn't sure where to post this or even if someone has already considered this so I apologize in advance. But here is my Netflix pitch. If you don't want to read the bulk and just get to my idea, skip to the part that's in bold.
 
I love TV. I love Movies. I love talking about them with friends and family and introducing people to shows or movies that I've seen. Many times, with TV shows especially, I talk about a specific segment or bit that was in an episode that perfectly encapsulates everything great about that show. I then want to show it to them. This is where the issues start.
 
Last night I was reading a great article on Grantland [ranking the best episodes of Louie](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/ranking-every-episode-louie/). For fans of the show it's a great read and you'll come away reminiscing about your favorite episodes (and wondering why they were ranked where they were). It's one of my favorite shows on TV (Louis C.K. is a GENIUS) and I'm always trying to get people to watch. One of my go to scenes to tell people about is the scene in the car [where he jams to The Who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6E-NXGJTqU). The article links to a video on Youtube of the clip, but the quality isn't very good. It's shot by some guy on his cellphone with poor sound quality. Frustrated, a quick Youtube search only resulted in one other video with similar quality. How am I supposed to spread the word about this show when I can't even show it to friends? Tracking down the episode and trying to fast forward to the right part would take forever and that can't be shared on Facebook or Twitter like a Youtube link can.
 
The problem here is content rights. These Youtube users are getting hit with copyright infringement notices by uploading videos of content they don't own. Obviously the companies who own the rights to the content have every right to try to monetize their content and I don't blame them for wanting it taken down. However, the internet is a powerful tool and word of mouth can spread quickly over social media. Users want to be able to share their favorite clips, why isn't there an easy and legal way to do it?
 
I'll be honest here, I'm a pirate. I have been for years. I started back in high school when I had no job and couldn't afford to go to the movies or buy music off iTunes. I've torrented pretty much everything you can imagine and have built up quite the collection over the years. I love high quality music and have almost 500 GB in songs formatted in FLAC. However, I don't listen to any of it anymore. I have it all stored on an external drive somewhere in my basement. Why? I now pay $10 a month for Spotify and it's the best investment I've ever made. I get access to all of my music and can create all kinds of playlists without storing any of it locally on my phone. That 500 GB of music I have? It's all there, *but it's not there.* Sure streaming isn't always 100% reliable and I do prefer to have content locally, but that's to be expected. It is just easier for me to pay the $10 a month, and isn't that all we want as consumers?
 
This is why Netflix is so popular. The low price and all the great content it provides is worth it for people who want to cut the cord or don't want to get into murky waters by pirating. It has been proven by studies that [Spotify](https://torrentfreak.com/music-piracy-continues-to-decline-thanks-to-spotify-110928/) and [Netflix](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1560720/business-matters-how-netflix-reduces-piracy) reduce piracy, largely in part because these services make it so easy to access popular content. They also produce content in house that is fantastic (House of Cards, anyone?) that isn't available anywhere else. If you're a TV junkie, you need to be in on House of Cards. Therefore you need Netflix.
 
**So what do we, as consumers, need in order to share our favorite clips with our friends?** These companies want their content viewed because it makes them money. How can they provide what we want in a way they can still make money? The answer is simple: Netflix. You're probably thinking well hey, Netflix already makes it easy for us to watch what we want. And you're right. But they can add one feature that would make life easier for everyone AND make them money at the same time: Easily share clips from user to user using the Netflix service.
 
They have the streaming ability in place. They have the popular content. They have the user base. Why isn't this already a thing? Say you're watching an obscure movie on Netflix one night and one scene absolutely blows you away. What's the first thing you'll do? Call or text a friend or family member and tell them to watch it. They'll ask why? You start explaining this scene and they have absolutely no idea what is going on. You search Youtube and it's nowhere to be found. This feature would allow you to set endpoints on the video and generate a link to send your friend or family member that allows them to watch that clip. No searching for the movie, no fast forwarding to the right part, they can simply watch the clip as if it's a Youtube video embedded on a website. And it's all integrated in Netflix.
 
It would work similar to the way Spotify handles music embedded on websites. Click play on a song and it immediately starts playing in your Spotify app. With this service, you could be reading an article about a show and there would be an embedded video that is hosted by Netflix. Click play and if you're logged into Netflix, it plays. High quality, perfect sound, just as if you were watching it on Netflix. What if you're not a Netflix subscriber? You see a 30 second ad before the video plays. Simple. Easy. And you still get to see the content you want without all the hassle. Don't want to watch the ad? Subscribe to Netflix with a simple click of a button (and a quick form on the next page). More money for Netflix, more views of the content, everyone is happy.
 
So why can't this be a thing? Is this not the next logical progression for Netflix? I can't be the only one who's thought of this idea. What do you guys think?
 
**TL;DR: Watch clips of content on Netflix through Youtube style videos without opening the Netflix app that are shareable with friends and family.**

"New Show Wednesday, empowerment done right","I just wanna appreciate this new netflix show about Addam's familys titular character.

I feel this is not only a very well written, directed and acted show, but it does something many other shows and movies fail at.

It presents a strong female lead without putting down her male counterparts.
She is seemingly good at everything, yet she is not Mary Sue perfect and has flaws and needs help of other characters, often help of one of the male characters. Speaking of the male characters, they are all seemingly competent in their own skill areas and not bumbling  useless fools, so many girlpower showes today like to portray men as.

Thoughts about Wednesday,"I have now watched the show halfway through and overall I really liked it. The style was great and Wednesday is an awesome mc. And I absolutely loved Thing and rest of the family.

But. There were some things that annoyed me:
1. The soundtrack. There were some good parts but overall the music felt a bit tired. Maybe I have watched too many kdramas, which usually have very good soundtracks, but it really felt like a tv soundtrack to me and not in a good way. Also where was the opening? No theme?
2. The drama. I am so tired of teen drama. I feel that when there are multiple people in a relationship it makes the feelings feel thinner which is why I hate love triangles. Also if there are so many troubles like in the first five minutes of relationship then I just don’t have any trust of it lasting. I also hate when there is a rivalry between girls there always has to be a boy between them. Also, where are the slow-burn romances? (If there even has to be one) I just wanted to ask the boys (lol, I don’t even remember their names) to leave Wednesday alone.
3. The pacing. Sometimes the scene changes felt jarring/ too quick and the pacing could have been better. 
4. The “feminism”. It annoyed me when Wednesday used the terms “mansplaining” and “male-gaze” in places which felt completely wrong. Like the mansplaining was the dude just telling her what his dad had told him and the dress felt more like female-gaze. So it seemed more like the show made fun of those terms and didn’t take them seriously enough to use them in right places. The cat suit would have been a better place for a male-gaze comment.

Cobra Kai is Overrated,"Cobra Kai is nowhere close to Stranger Things and you would ask, why? Well, that was a good question...for a starter...I am very fantasizing about the entertainment industry/Pop-Culture since I was a little boy and remember that my mother and father would always buy me a various Disney Adventures and Nickelodeon Magazine which features BTS facts about my favorite television series and films. 


So, that would inspire me to follow the stars of my favorite series and films such as The Sprouse Twins, Miley Cyrus (don't ask), HSM cast members, Miranda Cosgrove, Victoria Justice, Drake Bell, Jonas Brothers, Big Time Rush, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and so on. So, my point is that...it is like looking behind the curtain just like in Wizards of Oz as a guy stated that “Don’t Pay Attention to the Man behind the curtain” implies that the kids in Cobra Kai don't get me to peek behind the curtain as in behind the scenes as it feels like a fanmade series as it first came out as a YouTube Production. 



Anyway, the plot is good but there are over the top in CK as their acting is just meh as it is a YT project, not Professional type like in ST as Gaten (Dustin), Caleb (Lucas), and Sadie (Max) has taken a role in 3 different Broadway productions (Le Mirbesobale, Lion Kings, and Annie) before taking the cast into the series and I could say the same thing about Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard (Mike) as they appear in various Pre-ST projects before taking the role of Eleven and Mike respectively and Noah Schnapp (Will) is just a cute kid into a great looking guy and he might be or not my man crush...I have many celebrity crushes who are not in a very romantic way, OK!?!? Another one is Cole Sprouse and Ryan Reynolds...Millie Bobby Brown, Sadie, Robin, Selena Gomez, Kevin Hart, Miranda Cosgrove, Sarah Cameron of Outer Banks, Finn Wolfhard, Nick Jonas, Victoria Justice, Debby Ryan, Tom Holland, Steve Harrington....ok, let's move on. 



The point is that CK has to lack attractiveness and inexperienced kids actors as I don't recall any of them being in any projects before CK as they seem pretty lost at what they were doing on and off cameras which tells me that they are not ready for the show business. So, Stranger Things is a masterpiece of true arts and crafts that Duffer Bros. has worked on series since they first developed the series 8 years ago. I watched a video where a brilliant casting director helped ST to become the greatest series on Netflix and she explained how she has chosen these actors and actresses to play these iconic roles in the series and knows how to make television and film an excellent production in the entertainment industry. 



Now, with CK, it seems like they were putting a play with booking some cast members from the film series on the series but HOW!?!? Anyway, I just feel they were rushing things up as I want it to step out of the box but it didn't. So, whoever hired those cast members, scriptwriters, stunts, etc should be fired. So, I think that they should have canceled it after season 4 as it was very difficult to keep up as why did they book a celebrity cameo in a FREAKING drama series as we don't give a crap about Carrie Underwood!?!? ALRIGHT!?!? 


ST might have booked some huge stars from the 80s but they were in their characters as they knew that we love this series because it's just everything and wants to stay focused on the storylines as that's how it became a very successful drama series as we know and love. So, with that...ST is running Netflix and not CK, Alright!?!? 


So, I feel very attached to ST because for numerous reasons it has a place in my heart I feel like it changed my life forever and CK did not do anything that make me very attracted to it but plot-wise is the only thing that interests me in this series. So, I am not a fan of karate as I think that it was just strange to me that it helps you to grow but how does it get you to the Pro Level like Football, Basketball, Baseball, Tennis, etc? 

Alright, it is my opinion as to how I grow up to glue my eyes to the television where I see the cast of my favorite television and film series on series doing some craziness and out of the box...that's who I am.  Well, CK is just cheesy to me as it seems like the series has been shot with a store-bought camera and written by Non-Experienced writers and the casting was pretty bad as it tells me that it is a homemade project and just all about who is better at karate and that is a most ridiculous thing that I ever heard.

New show idea; Home Decorating Nightmares,"This will be a reality show where wives can decorate houses however they see fit.  They can invite their friends, mothers, maybe in-laws to help decorate.

I have had this happen.  My wife and I purchased our first home.  She mentioned her mom wanted to decorate our bathroom.  I said, please not the upstairs one.  Just the basement one.  The upstairs one is perfect.

I get the call as I’m driving home one day. She decorated the bathroom and it looks amazing.  The theme is mermaids.  We are not teenagers, why would it be mermaids?  I walk into it.  The stench of potpourri smacks me in the face like a frying pan.

Pink, purple, baby blue all over.  This is the most horrid thing I have ever scene.  It looks like Mary Kay exploded in here.

Back to the concept of the show.  After the wife and her cohorts destroy the house with their decor, the husband will come in with a professional designer who will critique and redesign the house into a suitable living environment for all.

We can add in a stand up comedian to alleviate the situation.  We all know most of these women will think their taste is best.

[EU] A kind message to Netflix...,"(First... sorry for any mistakes....not a native speaker here.)

Dear Netflix,


I have heard that you will expanding in some European countries this fall. At first I was excited, thinking that we will be also be able to enjoy the many benefits that you are offering in the U.S. for so long.


But then I became suspicious. What if you do not have the same quality and variety as in the U.S.? Then you're just another clone of the many already on the market streaming services.

When I analyze the situation in Germany, then there are currently three major streaming services here: Amazon Instant Video , WatchEver and Maxdome.
There are some differences here and there, but basically they offer the same.

I know, the European Distribution Rights for movies and series are quite different and more difficult than in the U.S., but if you offer the same as the other streaming services, then you will be just another brick in the wall and why should people bother to use your service, if they already have the same offer in their actual subscribed streaming service.

What would be the optimum fur EU countries?

- same variety like in US
- local and english dubs
- also iOS/Android/WP/PS/XBOX/Wii apps to use the service
- preloading to watch it offline on the tablet/smartphone




Hopefully,

a potential Netflix user in the future

I finally watched that 90's show..,"I actually really enjoyed it a lot. It was a bit rough at first but I think it captured the overall essence of the original show. I will say the season felt more like a ""test run"" of sorts but it worked.

If they make season 2 here are my suggestions. 

1.) Kelso's daughter: she's Jay's older sister, it'd be very easy to make her into the ""Laurie"" of the group especially since she's a kelso lol

2.) I'd like to see the original cast more. It'd be nice if we saw Jackie and kelso actually being parents. I'd also wanna see them actually interact. Like how does Fez feel about kelso now? Since he stole Jackie. Also I'd love to see Donna and Eric with Jackie and kelso since their kids are dating.

3.) Bob should move in with Kitty and Red, that would just be a fun time.

4.) The wardrobe needs to look a little more 90's. There were references to the 90's but it didn't *feel* like the 90's ya know? More references, more memories, all that good stuff

CC 2 is an awful film.,"I just finished watching The Christmas Chronicles 2, and I have to say that it is objectively a bad film. Now, before people start coming at me telling me it’s a kids film and it’s not meant for me, save your breath. Is that any kind of excuse really? There are so many amazing kids films out there, and even if I don’t necessarily enjoy one of them. I can usually appreciate the strong writing or relatable characters. 

But this film is just terrible. The writing is crap, the acting is even worse and Netflix being Netflix just had to virtue signal again with the line ‘it should be called Mrs. Claus’ village’. Really? You’re a something year old young child and that’s the first thing on your mind seeing this magical Christmas village? I was honestly expecting Santa to die so that Mrs. Claus could really start being an empowered woman. 

Anyway, I just thought this was another shit jewel in Netflix’s crown. 

Also, who keeps hiring Julian Dennison? The guy can not act his way out of a paper bag. I would say he’s a worse actor than Ruby Rose, but that isn’t a hard feat to pull off. That guy was definitely hired because of the way he looks. It was a diversity hire, certainly not a talent one.

Sense8 may have been the best television show ever made..,"...and it got cancelled just when it was about to get EPIC. There was so much room for it to grow from a thing of exciting beauty to something of earth shattering MAJESTY haha. The central diversity theme was a breath of fresh air (and I am a vanilla hetero dude), the characters were some of the most loveable I've ever seen, the production captured the central concept so perfectly, the score complemented the show flawlessly and I found myself empathising with the core characters so much that I experienced a huge range of emotions in a way I didn't even know I could just from watching TV. 

Why are the only shows I really fall in love with the ones that suffer an untimely and undeserved death? What is wrong with people? Coronation Street is older than I am and Law and Order goes on for a miserable, boring decade and births warped little mutant Law and Order spin off babies but something smart and wonderful like Sense8 gets murdered? 

At least there's some poetry in it; It was the masses' contempt for beautiful, different things that killed it. 

If anyone who helped to make Sense8 what it was ever reads this, just know that I bloody love you for giving that to me. I actually grew as a person by watching this show. Maybe that sounds ridiculous to some people but then they probably haven't watched Sense8.

The Real Reason Behind Netflix's Terrible New Ratings System [ALL],"It's all about money folks. Netflix did not change to this new system because Amy Schumer complained about the one star ratings for her special [deserved as far I'm concerned. I don't find her funny at all] but that Netflix paid Schumer at least 20 million dollars with a commitment for one or two more specials at the same price.  Those one star ratings for Schumer and their other unpopular but expensive flops are direct hit to Netflix's bottom line and potential subscribers.  This new system is a way of hiding the bad ratings for their expensive purchases that turn out to be bad investments. 

One of the bullshit reasons Netflix gave for changing the system was that people were giving things they weren't interested in and hadn't watched 1 star so it wouldn't show up as suggested content. That's nuts.  Netflix used to have a ""NOT INTERESTED"" option that would have handled this problem. Without the star system how are we supposed to tell if something is any good without seeing ratings for it? I generally trusted the old system. Now I have no idea what to choose anymore.

And now they intend to ban password sharing, which we do with our kids who live in another place.

let's get this straight.,"People aren't unsubscribing from Netflix for any other reason than the constant price increases.

We came to netflix for movies, shows, cartoons and all else netflix has to offer.

With the ever growing population of streaming services, platforms, bundle deals, were less inclined to keep netflix because it doesn't offer the same value as some of the competitors.

But with that in mind, there are those of us that stay because we're used to it, we have our tailored list of content established amongst our profiles.

But to be so limiting in how many screens we can use with our subscription, the constant losses of various BIG shows or movies, the horrible netflix adaptaptations, the failed netflix originals...

When ""Family Guy"" left netflix, it was a blow at least for me. Then ""Friends"", ""Futurama"", it was irritating to say the least.

When most people have more than one streaming service, and the prices keep going up, we make a choice of what stays and what goes.

I still have a netflix subscription, but it's hanging on by a thread for me.

"Maybe a unpopular opinion, just finished Squid Game, I thought it was overhyped. Spoilers**","Everyone and anyone was asking me ""have you seen it?"". I do like these kind of obscure foreign programmes and from what people were saying around me it was right up my alley.
Things like 'the story is incredible', it's really violent and brutal' etc. I asked them not to talk about the plot or spoil anything and luckily stayed away from any spoilers.

I finished it and thought it was good, not great not amazing but good. A little predictable, I kind of had a theory from the start that only one person could win, it was solidified when Jun-ho finds the docs of the past winners. 

The thing with these shows is if you don't see someone die then they are most likely still alive, the crazy lady gets dragged away, you don't see her get killed, same with the Jun-ho, Il Nam and Ali. You don't seem them get killed. The concept was good, the way the story was told was good, I like the characters but never got too invested as I know they could get killed at any moment.

I honestly think I expected too much from it because all the attention it received. The twist was good the about Jun-ho brother being the front man. 

What was great was how the VIPs sort of represent us the audience and how people in society would be desperate to do anything for money if it meant they wouldn't have to worry ever again about finances.

The Big Bang Theory is a brilliant show,"I'm prepared to be downvoted to Tartarus, but I'm going to do it anyway. 


The laughing track? MOST sitcoms have that. Would I prefer a show without it, sure. But does it make a show ""terrible?"" No. You get used to it. 


People criticise Leonard and Penny's relationship, but ""Ross and Rachel""are apparently the sitcom couple of the century? I don't think it's fair to do that. Their relationship was far from perfect, but it was fun and worthy of a 12 season storyline. 


To those who point out Howard's character( do you hate Barney Stinson too?), I think you're missing that this man had great character development. He went from being, well, stupid, to the first person in the friend group to being married and having two kids. 


Yes, a lot of jokes are made at Sheldon's expense, but then again, aren't the jokes targeted at everyone throughout the show?


A lot of the jokes mimic real life scenarios. People (especially redditors lol) being made fun of because they live with their parents (Howard), people being made fun of because they are nerds and socially incompetent. It's chill. I don't think people need to get offended on behalf of humanity for that.

I'm really trying to like Alice in Borderland but this was just stupid...(Spoilers for Season 1),"So after having watched the brilliant Squid Game, I was looking for something similar. I saw an acquaintence on social media mention Alice in Borderland so I decided to give it a go.

Unpopular Opinion: If we want Netflix to stop cancelling shows then we need to permit them a larger platform to advertise their shows - i.e their own site.,"I get it everyone hates ads, but as we are seeing as of late many shows are not getting the attention they deserve as a result of being underrepresented in marketing, but really what more can Netflix do?

Most here proudly tout the fact that they use ad block, have cut cable, and write rants every time they see an autoplayed trailer on Netflix's streaming service. 

But then in the same breath get upset that all these shows are not being presented to them and then scratch their heads when they are cancelled. 

And Netflix can't slow down their pacing, they have to keep up with growing competition and people already complain that their library isn't large enough.

Why Promote Illegal Drugs?,"There seems to be a lot of shows on Netflix that promote illegal drugs. 

I've been a psychotherapist for many decades and have done a lot of work with criminals, drug addicts, and people with mental problems. That's thousands of people over 30 years and I have worked in some of the most high crime areas of Philadelphia. 

I just watched The Business of Drugs and this super naive ""CIA analyst"" was basically defending drug dealers over several shows saying they're just ""putting food on the table"" which is the same crap I've heard countless times. Meanwhile, most of these kind of people, male and female, are monsters. They do not care about other people and most have unlimited power over drug addicts. 

Many drug dealers have told me, while crying, that they have made women have sex with their dogs, for drugs when they have no money. So, that kind of thing is only a small portion of all the weirdness. I have known so many women that did things like that, constantly get raped, and so forth due to drugs. I know women that sold their kids to drug dealers for sex, to get drugs in exchange. 

In prison I met a girl housed with her mom, which everyone thought cute. Then, she told me she wanted her cell change, because her mom sold her to a ""black guy"" to have sex with when she was a little girl. So, that's what drugs to so people can feel ""high"". Imagine being that girl grown up and now in jail with her mom that made her a ""sex slave"" and mentally ill. 

For middle class viewers drugs are about ""feeling high"" but in drug culture, it's extremely EXTREMELY dirty and degrading daily life. These are mostly super damaged people, sociopaths, and psychopaths. 

Also, on that show, and others on Netflix, there's ""information"" about psychedelics and the message is that they're ""therapy"" in a pill, which of course is not true. There's literally decades of research that the experience you have on them is not real. People on these drugs believe they're having some insight or creative revelation, but once off the drugs, they can't describe the insight they had. So, it's an illusion.  

This was already covered in the 50s when LSD was being used for ""therapy"". It might be interesting, but real therapy is like going to the gym, it's a lot of work and the only way to get fit. It's about changing your personality and behaviors by working to learn about yourself and change. The same goes for MDMA. Feeling fake ""love"" is not the same as real love based on your beliefs. Just the same, alcohol and weed can make you feel ""happy"" but it's not the same happiness as doing something of substance. 

With all of that being said, I would like all drugs to be legal, to destroy the crime around it, but until then, drugs are extremely dangerous when illegal. I know people who died from weed, due to in being laced with other deadly drugs. I gave a drug test to a person who bought cocaine, and it was filled with PCP, opiates, benzos, and more. It made them psychotic and get into a car accident. Most ""Molly"" isn't Molly but a bunch of crap mixed together. I know many people who became psychotic from psychedelics. Toothless young people from meth, and so forth. 

The rich people that make Netflix shows don't know anything about drugs and drug culture yet they promote stuff that is pure trash on this movie service, which is mostly family oriented. I don't get it, they are obviously all promoting illegal drug use. Why not some kiddie porn shows next? 

It reminds me of conspiracy theory stuff where people in control of the media are purposely trying to harm people through propaganda and all of these show are propaganda.

"[US]/[XBox1]: God damn it Netflix, I love you, but you REALLY need to get your act together [RANT]","To start off I want to say I love you Netflix; better yet I WANT to say I love you COMPLETELY, but things keep me from doing so.  I'm willing to overlook some selection issues compared to other services and the occasional falling in and out with certain content providers, but as a whole I've been realizing as of late I'm not even bothering with my ""proper"" cable TV anymore, I'd rather just play something off you.

That being said there's a few things that need to happen before I acknowledge that you're doing anything more than a mediocre performance.

I first used you on the Xbox360, since nearly it's inception, and it was great.  Sure, there were some growing pains in the UI.  We grew together.  At first I would hate you, then get accustomed to you, then adapted to your hotkeys and wondered how I got on without you when I used other services.

Needless to say since this last gaming generation I noticed your quality went downhill, sharply.  I didn't care for the Kinect as a gaming peripheral, but HOLY CRAP did I love being able to talk to my multimedia player, telling it to pause and stop and general controls when it came to navigation and selection.  I was hooked.  So much so that when it came time to upgrade to an Xbox One that I specifically wanted the Kinect bundle, not because of any gimmicks with the system, or even concerning gaming in general, but because the wife and I became so accustomed to the voice commands when we played Netflix that it wasn't an option NOT to get it.  Needless to say, your application presented on the Xbox One is crap, at least comparatively.

The application [still] doesn't work in snap mode, an issue I found out is as old on the forums since early in the console's release.  If you Google hard enough, you can find a thread that calls for the patching and updating of the app (which I've come to find out is Netflix's responsibility, not Microsoft's) to actually make these seemingly sensical features a reality, but they have yet to be ""fixed"" after all this time.  Also, in the app functionality (a point I am particularity annoyed by) seems to forget that you're in the Netflix app all together.  For example, when I launched Netflix on the 360, I could immediately pick my profile and commands by simply speaking ""Xbox, profile 1"".  Now when I say ""Xbox"" while in the app to initiate the voice commands, it takes me to out to the base line home screen and asks me which basic gaming/TV/etc. function I want to perform; nothing that has syntaxes native to the app itself.  I have to dance between syntaxes for the home screen and specifically the Netflix app before I get the visual prompts for the voice commands of the app.  **TL:DR:  Why the hell does the Netflix app work spotlessly on the 360 but poorly on the One?**

Needless to say, I love Netflix.  You are, worst case scenario, at least as good, if not better, than basic television.  You provide plenty of content to watch that I am grateful for.  BUT HOLY SHIT, YOU REALLY NEED TO GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!  And across platforms (gaming consoles, smart apps, phones, tablets, etc.) the capability is so inconsistent (phones/tablets/browsers have a piss-poor ""Recently Played"" menu built in whereas the console versions give you easily playable queues to pick up on where you left off.) 

Seriously Netflix, I would love you so much and sing your praises daily if you'd only adjust a few things that seem so trivial in the long run.  (You already have so much of these expectations established.  It's just a matter of taking all of the positive features YOU ALREADY PROVIDE across individual platforms and conglomerate them.)

I'm not asking you to re-invent the wheel here Netflix, I just want you to take the good, solid aspects of your current services across the board that are already working fine, and make them standard for all of your applications.  Not only do I feel that's not asking much, but for goodness sake you are already accomplishing these tasks.

This was far longer than I wanted it to be, but this was something I needed to get off my chest.  I fully understand these are ""first world problems"" but I feel bad because if Netflix could only conglomerate the best of the features it has existing across platforms it could be unstoppable!  (or at least Super-Ultra-Mega-Awesome)

What content should Meghan and Harry produce for Netflix to earn the second half of their $100M contract?,"I read today that Netflix is demanding H&M produce content of “real interest” to get the rest of their money (https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflix-reportedly-tells-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-what-to-deliver-for-dollar50m?ref=home?ref=home).

Thought it would be an interesting (and thoroughly unproductive) thought experiment to hear what they’d watch H &/or M talk about. My ideas (in no particular order and with no illusion that they’re any good):

- **Royalty.** A lifestyle show where they feature a different person/animal considered the “royalty” of their profession/breed (like really famous in their niche community… for some reason “roller derby royalty” came to my head as the first episode)

- **Archetypes.** terrible name for a podcast but maybe could be rebooted for Netflix. The whole idea of talking to famous beautiful rich woman about breaking down stereotypes seems pretty tone deaf to me, but maybe there’s something there for interviewing real people who are breaking down barriers in gender roles?

- **The Look.** Super gorgeous couple, new Dior contract… I know they’re about social Justice but maybe good old fashioned haute couture and impossibly beautiful people?

- **CNN Heroes but for Netflix.** Speaking of social Justice, maybe they follow 10 lesser known nonprofits around for a year and tell their stories. 

- **Formulaic Elimination Reality Game Show.** Cooking, crafting, cupcakes, home makeovers, food trucks, drag queens, makeup artists… not sure what their particular brand of game show is there’s, but I’d watch.

Black Mirror's last episode (with Miley Cyrus) is shaming the show. It's worth of a Disney channel show.,"The episode that destroyed black mirror.

"[All] ""Narcos: Mexico"" is frustratingly inconsistent, and has lost touch with the magic of the mainline series. (spoilers)","While still compelling, Narcos: Mexico takes its artistic license too far.

On the one hand, we have a brilliant performance of rising Mexican trafficker Miguel Felix Gallardo as a kind of rationalist, Stringer Bell type surrounded by childish maniacs and a few old-timers who just don't see his vision.  This causes us to sympathize with his vision, but then they keep doing that over and over - Gallardo the voice of reason, talking crazy guys down from unnecessary violence.  

There comes a point where it starts to seem like hagiography - like they're trying to make this guy out to be a hero for a long time.   It acts as if almost everything truly despicable around him were an accident beyond his control.  Then when he starts inevitably becoming a monstrous figure more directly, it happens all of a sudden, by totally discarding the character logic previously built.

One moment he's a vulnerable, thoughtful human being who was stayed that way through every crisis and personal near-disaster, but then he's suddenly a savage.  I'm sure the character evolution of the real Gallardo followed more relevant human logic than that.

Moreover, every single episodes has **so many unnecessary cliches** and tropes - things that just don't happen, and only serve to highlight that this is a fictionalized account of real events rather than a docudrama.  That's frustrating as hell, because the first seasons of Narcos stayed relatively close to what actually happened - they were compelling and surreal enough that reality was mostly all they needed.

This, not so much.  The scripts are *cringe-worthy* at points.  It's all very theatrical and melodramatic far too often, with a lot of fake, contrived tension that's not necessary at all.

But at the same time, there are moments of such brilliant insight, that I have to wonder how many people were involved in the writing and editing: It's like Gallardo one moment has no connection to Gallardo another.  Very frustrating.

Almost like they subcontracted this one out instead of using the same team from the main Narcos thread. 

Edit: Yup.  Can't *ever* criticize a Netflix show, even in the mildest terms here.  Praise it 97%, but if you criticize it 3%, you get downvoted without fail.  Sigh.  Fix your sub, guys.

Was Stranger Things really that good? (Spoilers) [US],"So I've watched Stranger Things a few days after it was released and simply felt unsatisfied. I've kept my thoughts about the show to myself since watching it until seeing all the praise it's been getting with the growing number of viewers. In my opinion the show felt like it was trying too hard with the 80's nostalgia. There were scenes obviously making homages to classics as well as cramming Ronald Reagan and He-man on the television. The show felt slow and not in a suspenseful way. The music doesn't help either, it was overpowering rather than complementing the visuals. If any of you have seen It Follows I would say that film nails it with the visuals and score.

Army of the Dead is decent!,"Zack Snyder made a pretty decent zombie film here! I wouldn't say it's absolutely incredible, but worth your time! Almost everyone was good in this, except that safe cracking guy, he was absolutely annoying and good for nothing except cracking the damn safe. Hated that guy. The ones that you are supposed to hate, they did a damn good job at making you hate them, I give them that. 

That one guy that beheaded the queen zombie to sell her head to Tanaka, he gets destroyed by that kickass zombie tiger, loved it, he deserved that 100%. Same goes for Burt.... Fucking scumbag.

Rest of the characters were good, but of course Bautista, he was fucking awesome. He was in awesome, his character was awesome, and.....I kinda figured from the get-go that he was gonna die in this. Just seemed too easy for him to survive. I'm glad they did go that route because it gave more meat to his character and the end of the movie.

Also....the second half was by far the best part. First half was okay, but nothing.....NUTS happens until the second half. 

One last thing...... everything that happens in this movie... it happens all because that wife literally couldn't wait to suck off her new husband.....

Netflix is stingy about showing me 5 star titles in their recommendations and genre lists for some reason.,"Netflix is stingy about showing me 5 star titles in their recommendations and genre lists for some reason.

For example, if I do a Netflix search for *Downton Abbey* it shows up as 5 stars and not rated by me (so far so good--this is not my complaint), but 
if I look at the list of British TV Dramas and sort by rating or year, *Downton Abbey* doesn't show up at all (this is my complaint). 

In case it makes any difference, I'm on a DVD plan with no streaming.

I'm seriously considering cancelling because two of the main reasons I use Netflix are for the recommendations and for discovering things I don't already know about.

Do they do this to everyone? Is it an [intellectual property issue](http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1630e0/netflix_is_stingy_about_showing_me_5_star_titles/c7sas2m?context=3)? Is it ""customer management""? Are there workarounds?

**Edit:** After thinking about this post for a while, it seems to me the most likely reason is that they would like to promote DVDs that they get cheaply and have in abundance and downplay DVDs they have to buy at greater cost and have in short supply.

**Edit:** The near consensus seems to be that Netflix' recommendation system isn't the best way to find out about new things. Thanks to flickyboy for suggesting  http://www.avclub.com/ and http://www.metacritic.com/ for recommendations. Also, from another thread I found https://www.icheckmovies.com/ .

Cancelled my subscription after 2 years being a customer....,"Today, I officially decided to cancel my Netflix subscription.

My PERSONAL reasons:

\- It seems that more and more great content is no longer offered on Netflix, or won't appear at all.

\- Somehow, Netflix deemed it necessary to increase their monthly fee from 13,99 EUR to 15,99 EUR (4k version). Less content = higher fees?

\- The quality of Netflix´s own content is declining rapidly, compared to e.g. HBO. Even a solid serie like e.g. Designated Survivor they were able to ruin, after purchasing it from ABC. Now, it´s cancelled...

\- Lastly, their is too much diversification between countries. One country is offering specific movies and series (e.g. the US), but at the same time, those aren't available in Spain, or take ages to release.

Should Netflix increase their content and quality in the future, I might reconsider.

In the meantime, I do have HBO and Amazon Prime video from my provider, and might consider the Disney Channel, once it hits Europe (depending on the amount of content).

**La Casa De Papel**

The fascinating video calls of the Resident Evil Netflix show,"I wasn't convinced to watch the new show, but a friend convinced me to watch it together and we've been laughing about one thing in particular for 15 minutes. I mark it as spoiler just in case, even if I think that the images only show the incompetence or disinterest in the production.

In episode 2 there is a video call and on the device screen you can see this:

https://preview.redd.it/igmrld98rlc91.jpg?width=1279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=133f443cffbb5918639b2c13d0d8ba52ea6deae7

The video call is made with Notepad! Ignoring the fact that they are using Windows 10 in 2036, it was as easy as not showing the taskbar, or at least if you put it, I don't know, use Skype. At least they have blurred the icons and the date/time.

Okay. An oversight. No problem.

We continue with the episode and now, another similar scene:

This is no longer an oversight. They are making a video call with Paint, the computer does not have an Internet connection, and the date/time is literally covered up. Not deactivated or removed (Windows does not leave that space), but in post-production someone has decided that the best solution was to paint over it.

Holy \*\*\*\*...

In each genre label theres the title then age rating, then whether it's a series or film (I only wrote if it's a series. If theres nothing next to the age rating it's a film.) If any of these seem intresting just comment the name and I'll write a description. I'll probably edit this later and give each show a description but still. Lmao... I talk about this as if it won't die in new.

Did anyone ever notice this?,"Did anyone ever notice just how much better a show (with a actual single story) becomes when you watch 1 episode per day?

1: Imagine you binge watch a season. Everything that happens in that season, all the charackters that appear and die. All the progress that happens in that season, everything happens in a single day, or maybe 2 days.

So when you watch 1 episode per day, the story happens over a long period of time. Days and weeks will go by before the story ends, which will feel like a much bigger ""adventure"" and journey.

2: When we sleep, we learn and imprint memories into our brains. Thats why, when i learn a song on my piano the entire day, i cant seem to succeed. Then i go to sleep, wake up the next morning and suddenly im much much better.

So when we watch a episode and sleep, we imprint the emotionis and feelings and the excitement. We imprint the memories of the charackters and just everything that happened in episode. That way, you build a much deeper connection to the charackters in the show when days go by and you sleep many times inbetween each episode.

Thoughts on the new Sabrina Series,"To be sure I watched this series twice over to make sure I wasn't just hating on it for no reason and my arguments could be valid.And yes granted the series has some amazing elements to it but there are so many that I really feel are a let down.To be clear this post is purely my own personal opinion of the show and may not reflect others. No hate to the hard work that went into creating this series and the incredible crew and actors who worked on it.

&#x200B;

*SPOILER ALERT:This post may contain spoilers so if you haven't seen the show don't read on.*

&#x200B;

Being that the series is set in the same universe as Riverdale, I do feel there are too many elements taken from that series and transplanted into this one.One of the things that makes riverdale so great is that it's (seemingly) normal life pumped up to the extreme flair and grandiosity that makes it addictive episode after episode.Riverdale also hosts many new faces in lead roles with the most well known actors being in the parents all of whom were in their own teen dramas back in their day.

Camila Mendes, Lili Reinhart, Madelaine Petsch, Cole Sprouse (who hasnt graced our screens since he was young) and so many others!

Where I feel Sabrina falls flat is the over acting doesnt match the rest of the shows vibe. The actors chosen could have been better cast, with Ambrose's newcomer actor Chance Perdomo being the best of the whole show.Not to mentioned the complete lack of spooky, magical content one might expect and crave from a series like this that promised to be darker and more spellbinding than the original coupled with the incredible set design, colour palette and wild adventures Riverdale already showed us we hoped at least a little of that would show up in this series.

&#x200B;

Kiernan Shipka's constant monologues are supposed to represent a modern 16 year old coming of age witch, rising up against the patriarchy in both her Human and Witch worlds. And yet her focus switches so much between one moment caring about something she's being 'forced' to do and the next caring about Harvey or something completely unnecessary and irrelevant to the storyline that when she does throw out her fierce and compelling statements they come across overdone and overacted with zero punch to them and no chills delivered.Not to mention Australian Actress Miranda Otto's forced american accent as Aunt Zelda who's haughty, stern, devout character falls flat under this frankly forced portrayel.Aunt Hilda's character is the perfect yin to her yang but there's zero chemistry between the supposed family. I was waiting all season to see the Aunts perform one grand spell that showed their authority and unity as a familial rock to Sabrina who consistently ignores their warnings and heeds of advice. Instead the writers have chosen to portray these two as weak and submissive to everything around them which I think is a mistake.

&#x200B;

Sabrina's friends fall under the same umbrella as her, each experiencing their own unique trials and supernatural events, they again don't have any likeable underdog qualities that make us as the viewer want to root for them and thus cheer them on when it's realized one has a gift and the other a guardian angel (perhaps) driving them to be greater than their mortal selves.Susie's characters was seemingly being set up for the perfect story ark without needing to overly exploit being transgender and instead focus on the struggle that comes with already transitioning at such a young age and dealing with the uncertenties of being both a teenager and a transgender one at that and then adding another element of ghosts and witches entering her life. Instead it's brought up a handful of times, quickly mentioned in some kind of scene that suggest abuse from other teenagers and then barely delved into. Granted yes she is a supporting character but there are so many ways to delve deeper into her charcter without taking up too much screen time or overshadowing Sabrinas storyline.

&#x200B;

Similarly with Rosalind who's eventual blindness and intertwining sixth sense should weave nicely into Sabrinas storyline, again misses the mark with so much lost potentially for story development.The perfect oppourtunity was provided with Sabrina, Roz, and Susie potentially all facing a supernatural event as a trio, the half with and her mortal sidekicks, and yet they broke up the characters, has Sabrina act jittery every time something supernatural was brought up leaving each character unsure and unseen amongst everything else going on.

&#x200B;

Overall this series really dissapointed me. I was so excited to see how the notorious Riverdale universe could translate into something with overt supernatural elements but unfortunately I feel the writers relied too heavily on our already existing love for Sabrina and attempted to cram as much storyline and different unanswered questions as they could into the one season without fleshing it all out a little more.Here's hoping that season 2 is a little better. And yes I will be watching the second season.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 3 stars out of 5 Ambrose is the best bit of the whole show.

- X-Ray: It works on the streaming device and on 2nd screen. Really neat

- and this should really be #1: No stupid autoplay !!!

Netflix getting too much hate on this sub,"I think the hate is too much, a bit unfair. Obviously, the password thing is a big issue and if that comes to affect me, then I'll cancel. But to say theres NOTHING on Netflix is subjective. For me, it introduced me and gave me access to awesome Korean shows. In addition, theres other genres like anime, classic movies or new movies, new shows like the Ozarks, the Witcher, etc. Its a fact that theres a bunch of random stuff that comes in and goes out and not all of them a masterpiece but theres usually something for someone to watch.

However, if it wasnt for netflix, we would have had cable far longer. Unfortunately, now theres so many streaming services that the cost of each total up to having a cable bill but at least we're able to choose what we want to watch. But hey, money speaks so if Netflix sees that so many subscribers dump them after their cheaper plan and commercials and password crackdown, then maybe they'll re-evaluate their choices and hopefully roll it back. If not, then they'll be doomed like Cable companies while we enjoy another service.

In the end, its just another streaming service but it hasnt been the absolute worst to deal with. For example, their customer support has been easy in my experience to deal with unlike DirecTV, AT&T, and Comcast.

Why has it been pushing the same show to me for years?

It's been the same one for me forever and it's low key driving me mental. We checked this show out when it was released back in 2018 or 2019, didn't like it. Kept getting it as the background on the home page (maybe a year later they started showing different ones which was a relief but then this popup thing started up). We unchecked it so it isn't in ""my list"". We downvoted it to show the algorithm we do not want it. Still kept pushing it. I even went so far as to watch the whole damn series (luckily only a couple dozen episodes), thinking if we'd already watched it the algorithm might stop telling us to watch it. Nope, still pushing it! Maybe six months or a year ago they began that feature where you can ""x"" things out of your ""continue watching"" list, so when you try a show and hate it, it isn't hanging around forever.

Money Heist Korea is better than original Money Heist - Prove me wrong,"Biggest criticism people have for Money Heist Korea - Copy & Paste

For the purpose of this argument, let's ignore that for now, otherwise I'd be going through a rabbit hole of what is and what isn't constituted as a cardinal sin when it comes to remakes and how much was actually copy & pasted. So to save time, can we rate the two shows in a vacuum?

There are a bunch of reasons why the Korean version is better, but for me personally its how they do a better job of the whole 'robin hood' narrative and they took elements of season 1 & 2 of the Original Money Heist to provide a more, 'justified' narrative. Having bad guys you could point to and having the protagonist having a connection with them, gave it a personal touch and also made their cause more 'justifiable'. Very reminiscent of Oceans Eleven 2001 (which ironically was also a superior remake), the crew were thieves, no war around it. But they made sure to bring in an antagonist that was magnetic in his repulsion. Which just netted approbation towards the thieves.

Now for the other 2 primary reason that I'd say that makes the Korean version better: Tokyo & Berlin.

Tokyo - Not an insufferable b\*tch. I am convinced anyone who likes the original Tokyo from season 1, has to be an edgy teen or someone who likes to crossdress. Because the Professor, Nairobi and Berlin were holding down the fort in season 1 and making it bearable. The female detective was cool as well, but Tokyo was a complete mess. Now Tokyo from the Korean version actually looked like someone who belonged in the Heist. She wasn't in her feelings in the middle of life and death situations, other than the occasional bouts. She was very pragmatic and most importantly, a leader. Her chemistry with the Professor and even more so, chemistry with Berlin is what cements her position as a good leader and handles strong female representation like a boss. Unlike the Spanish version, the Korean version never lost faith in Professor, especially as chaotically and randomly as Tokyo did in the Spanish version. As the good leader that she was, she knew losing your cool and throwing blame everywhere would just get everyone killed. So unlike the Spanish version, the decision to leave the Mint was her idea to get the train back on track and achieve communication with the outside, brilliant. Instead of bratty princess getting thrown out cause she won't stop causing a ruckus every time the wind shifts.

Berlin - Wasn't character assassinated (aka creepy rapist), which was even WEIRDER when they tried to make us like him???? WTF were they doing end of and post season 1, just let him die. Anyways, following on what i touched on above. Tokyo and Berlin chemistry or moreso, working together to get shit done, was what made the show actually enthralling. Even in season 1 when they had tension, they were still working in cohesion and being a compliment of each other. Whereas in the Spanish version, i can't recall for a single second where the two of them 'got along' and made it seem like these two should be running a heist together. Now i get it, Spanish Berlin was more suave and charming, which really played into the whole...creepy rapist, well? And the Korean Berlin was a bonafide hardass, who is always angry and bordering on psychopath, which they did tone down season 2. But he was supported with one hell of a tragic backstory, so considering HOW he turned out, the world should actually consider it a blessing. And of course, the acting was the highlight of the show, even if the Spanish version was more suave, with his track record and the showriter character assassinating and then trying to sort of redeeming him, it was all over the place.

Anyways, these are 2-3 of my main reasons why the Korean version was better, if you have any counter argument for it, other than copy & paste, i'd love to hear it.",5,0.58,15,OldFartneedYoungtart,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1672406573.0,False,False,False,2022-12-30 13:22:53,biggest criticism people have for money heist korea copy paste for the purpose of this argument lets ignore that for now otherwise id be going through a rabbit hole of what is and what isnt constituted as a cardinal sin when it comes to remakes and how much was actually copy pasted so to save time can we rate the two shows in a vacuum there are a bunch of reasons why the korean version is better but for me personally its how they do a better job of the whole robin hood narrative and they took elements of season of the original money heist to provide a more justified narrative having bad guys you could point to and having the protagonist having a connection with them gave it a personal touch and also made their cause more justifiable very reminiscent of oceans eleven which ironically was also a superior remake the crew were thieves no war around it but they made sure to bring in an antagonist that was magnetic in his repulsion which just netted approbation towards the thieves now for the other primary reason that id say that makes the korean version better tokyo berlin tokyo not an insufferable btch i am convinced anyone who likes the original tokyo from season has to be an edgy teen or someone who likes to crossdress because the professor nairobi and berlin were holding down the fort in season and making it bearable the female detective was cool as well but tokyo was a complete mess now tokyo from the korean version actually looked like someone who belonged in the heist she wasnt in her feelings in the middle of life and death situations other than the occasional bouts she was very pragmatic and most importantly a leader her chemistry with the professor and even more so chemistry with berlin is what cements her position as a good leader and handles strong female representation like a boss unlike the spanish version the korean version never lost faith in professor especially as chaotically and randomly as tokyo did in the spanish version as the good leader that she was she knew losing your cool and throwing blame everywhere would just get everyone killed so unlike the spanish version the decision to leave the mint was her idea to get the train back on track and achieve communication with the outside brilliant instead of bratty princess getting thrown out cause she wont stop causing a ruckus every time the wind shifts berlin wasnt character assassinated aka creepy rapist which was even weirder when they tried to make us like him wtf were they doing end of and post season just let him die anyways following on what i touched on above tokyo and berlin chemistry or moreso working together to get shit done was what made the show actually enthralling even in season when they had tension they were still working in cohesion and being a compliment of each other whereas in the spanish version i cant recall for a single second where the two of them got along and made it seem like these two should be running a heist together now i get it spanish berlin was more suave and charming which really played into the wholecreepy rapist well and the korean berlin was a bonafide hardass who is always angry and bordering on psychopath which they did tone down season but he was supported with one hell of a tragic backstory so considering how he turned out the world should actually consider it a blessing and of course the acting was the highlight of the show even if the spanish version was more suave with his track record and the showriter character assassinating and then trying to sort of redeeming him it was all over the place anyways these are of my main reasons why the korean version was better if you have any counter argument for it other than copy paste id love to hear it,money heist korea is better than original money heist prove me wrong,0

"Netflix new ""auto-play"" trailers are SO ANNOYING","Netflix just rolled out a new feature on apple tv.

now when you're browsing and stop on a title it autoplays a f-ing trailer, complete with audio! OR just plays random scenes from the movie with random music (maybe from the movie?)

dammit, there's a reason that ""watch trailer"" is an optional button on almost any other movie interface like amazon, or itunes, etc... 

I don't want to watch these trailers every time I pause to look at something! 

holy f---- it's annoying. 

It's like going to the mall and every time you glance towards a store a salesman runs up to you and starts singing about it. Makes you want to leave the mall. fast.

"Disney/Marvel is pulling their library from Netflix in 2019, and DC just pulled theirs out this past August... Both with plans to start up their own streaming services... How many streaming services do these companies think we'll subscribe too?","With Young Justice getting a season 3 soon, I thought I'd rewatch the first two seasons... Well this past August, DC pulled their library of shows off Netflix with the intention of launching their own streaming service in 2018. And Disney just recently announced they will be doing the same, once their contract with Netflix ends in 2019.

I am also an avid anime watcher, and even though Netflix's anime library (including original shows) is growing, they still don't simucast current shows. Your other options are services like Crunchyroll or Funamination, or even Amazon's Anime Strike (not even going into the fact that you need prime on top of the 5.99 service). Then you add on any other services you have like Hulu or HBO Go... And well, it's getting ridiculous, how many streaming services do these companies think we'll subscribe too before people just start turning towards pirating their favorite shows. It's getting to the point where all these service fees are adding up to an amount which is just too much for the average consumer... And so you either pick and choose which service you'll subscribe too and then the rest you just pirate, or you just pirate everything and subscribe to nothing (which I've been seeing more and more of recently).

I understand that Disney and DC will probably make more money by having their own streaming services... If the demand is high enough. But what I'm fearful of is other production companies and networks following suit and starting up their own pay streaming services. I don't know what the solution is, but I definitely believe that we are going to be seeing more and more streaming services geared towards individual brands and companies.

How many streaming services do you all pay for, and how many more would it take until you just started pirating? Or many you're already fed up and have taken the back road to watching your shows... I already gave up going to the theaters about 2 years ago, as it's just way too expensive, and it's not that hard to just ignore everything relating to the shows you're interested in... Until they come out on some sort of on demand rental service, like Xbox live or such.. I want to be able to pay for the shows and services I'm interested in, to support the artist and writers and actors... But it's becoming harder and harder to do so, as each is separating into their own services...

The Queen Cleopatra show is triggering and a complete disrespect to every Egyptian and potentially Greek person,"As an Egyptian, what Netflix just did with Cleopatra is triggering, It understand that you want to be more diverse with the cast in your shows but when you represent historical events you **HAVE** to be accurate.  Cleopatra was indeed an Egyptian queen but she was **white of Macedonian descent.** Some people will say she had an Egyptian side, which is not true, but even if she did, Egyptians were not black or white. Egyptians lived along the Nile valley for centuries and probably millenniums developing their own characteristics and skin color of a golden tanned \~wheat like\~ skin tone, for reference you can use GOOGLE and look at any antient Egyptian statue or wall painting and look at what color it is, or ask anyone you know that visited Egypt before.

&#x200B;

What Netflix is doing here is following an Afrocentrism movement that is wrongly trying to steal Egyptian History and culture to assign it to central Africans for no historical reason just because we live on the same continent, when they had their own History and culture very far away from Egypt.

Bob's Burgers is leaving Netflix [US],"Why aren't more people outraged???I've seen some posts on here where people saw a message when the show starts on Netflix that the show will be leaving on April 1st, but there's no other information to be found!

Can we please stop with the cliffhanger endings for Netflix shows when odds are we won’t even get a 2nd/3rd season?!,"Why does every single show on Netflix have to end on a major cliff hanger making the past 8 episodes your just watched completely meaningless? 

Then while waiting for the next season to finally see the conclusion of the cliffhanger the show either gets cancelled or the 2nd season is just another lead up to another cliffhanger. Never really coming to a good conclusion..

It really starts to make me hate watching tv shows no matter how good they are because I’m constantly feeling my time is being wasted by watching 8+ episodes and never actually concluding the seasons story. Instead they make the entire first season building up to that specific cliffhanger making the hours you watched wasted. 

I’m to the point where I’m just going to stick with watching movies which usually have a proper ending or older tv shows that have already concluded their stories.

A Haunting of Hill House. A modern horror masterpiece.,"Horror, to me, is one of the toughest genres to work with when it comes to filming. It is extremely difficult to instill a sense of utter and real terror into the viewers. The way this series portrays its paranormal world is phenomenal. Some scenes were able to make me feel a sense of dread I have never felt before. 

In the beginning, I was absolutely terrified and I loved it!  By the end, I was accepting and understanding.  It’s terror, sadness, bitterness, regret, love and happiness; all wrapped together with brilliant writing. I couldn’t ask for more.

The journey this series takes you on is terrifyingly beautiful. It’s something you will rarely find in any movie or TV series. Its art. The writing was so well done I felt like I was wrapped up in a book! Not a show. 

And just when I thought the downfall of Netflix content was set in stone they just completely knock it out of the park with this masterpiece.

"I called netflix to give them feedback about the ads playing between episodes of a show, so should you.","Hi Folks,

A big reason we got netflix was to get away from advertisements.  In the past day we noticed that Netflix has started showing Ads between episodes of shows.  So on the countdown timer between episodes they now (could) have an ad.

This is something that would be a deal breaker for us, and so I called and told them that.

The only way we can influence them is by giving them feedback.  We like netflix, but I hope if other people are irritated by this move, they will give them feedback so they know that is the case.

I am in South America and I can tell you how your future Netlflix will be and its awful,">**EDIT: A reporter contacted me to run a story about this** plus so many people have commented that it can't boil down to the SSID so I am going to clarify: I am not 100% sure it is the different SSIDs or the Wifi enhancer,etc. **What I am sure** is that no one was using my account except me and that Netflix doesn't disclose how exactly they track households. **Also this happened when we tried to watch Netflix downstairs as it was first working upstairs**. It is also true that the first representative said that if my Wifi was ""different"" then I needed an extra member wich costs extra $2.99. I tried to clarify whether that included the extender and he couldn't answer so I hang up and called again. The following two separate 1 hour calls were around doing the same steps over (changing passwords, logging out, explaining what was on the screen, etc) and over and they keep asking me if I was sharing my account (they asked multiple times). They'd put me on hold for 10 mins at the time so after a while I got fed up and hang up.

&#x200B;

Major Edit now that I am in front of my computer:

Netflix announced a pilot to [restrict password sharing in Latin America](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10870771/Netflix-runs-trial-crackdown-password-sharing-Peru-Chile-Costa-Rica.html) earlier this year. It's a test to then deploy it globally. Meaning, this is happening to me now but may happen to you next year.

Today my account got completely blocked because my house has two different WiFi signals, one upstairs and one downstairs. (It's a wifi enhancer). Same cable company, same bill but different SSIDs because the Wifi signal is not strong enough. After ~~1 hour~~  2 hours on the phone with Netflix they said I need to add an extra member if I wanted to watch TV downstairs!

I bet in a few months, they'll say it's one account per device and so on.

The streaming golden age for consumers is soon to end. Enjoy it while you can!

This is what ALL TVs in the house display after logging in. **You can see I am actually logged in** because there is a button to log out (or create an account). Already changed passwords to log out all devices and doesn't work. My account is bricked everywhere except for my computer. They keep asking the same questions (who are you sharing your account with. Who is watching Netflix right now (no one!)  etc...)

FINAL EDIT: Cancelled my account. Just when I was enjoying the Indian Matchmaker the most :/

Networks Don't Create Their Own Shows,"These threads keep popping up - **Anybody Upset that Netflix Keeps calling this show Original even though it's not**

To those who are unaware all Networks do this. 

Best example that always comes up. **Better Call Saul**

So many of you think it's an AMC original. It's not. AMC has exclusive distribution rights to the show in the United States and for a while that was the only region the show was being hosted.

Better Call Saul is actually as show created by Sony Studios. Sony Studios isn't owned by AMC nor did AMC commission them to create Better Call Saul. Sony Studios did all the leg work and then sold AMC the Distribution rights. ""Distribution rights"" sound familiar - it's what most of us know is Netflix's bread and butter - in reality it's all Networks bread and butter. This is how that economy works. 

Another example and resent complaint **The Bodyguard**.  Again many think it is a BBC original and Netflix is stealing their content and calling it their own. Wrong. 

The Bodyguard was created by a third party production company named Word Production. This production company is not owned by BBC. They sold BBC the distribution rights in the UK. BBC is only a distributor of the show not the creator. 

Netflix has as much claim to the originality of ""The Bodyguard"" as the BBC does and this claim they both make is permitted through contracts crafted between themselves and the production company that created the show. 

Some giant Networks do create their own shows and even in that instance - it is they themselves who shop out their production to other regions and then, in the case of netflix, give netflix permission to stamp their ""original"" on the title as apart of a contract that benefits both parties.

The Netflix user interface is designed to make it as hard as possible to find what you are looking for,"Every single change, every single decision they have made has been for this one purpose.

Netflix doesn't care *what* you watch, they only want to you spend as much time watching - i.e as little time browsing.

If anyone remembers, the early UIs used to have nice list of categories etc allowing user to filter and sort. Now we have -

- random categories like 'because you hovered over X for Y seconds', which jump around all the time, making sure you can never really find what you saw before or use muscle memory.

- categories all full of the same 'originals'

- auto play so users after some time will just give up and watch something

- no 'related' or 'also see' for a title, unlike every other content service ever. So you can't find something similar and have to rely on their 'algorithm'

- which is clealry a total hoax if its not actual malice. The recommendations are a joke. Users had a way to counter this using ratings, which of course they removed.

- the 'search' is not a real search. If you search for a title/actor for which they have no content, you'll see random related content with no idea who's in it, its misleading.

And the biggest reason of course -

The content catalog is shrinking drastically. Their 'originals' are bad or mediocre at best with a few exceptions. If Netflix actually allowed users to find what they wanted, users would soon realize how little they have.

The ideal user for Netflix is someone who goes in and clicks on the first shiny thing. By promoting their originals they of course gurantee they are watched more, thus validating their existence. And they have a huge positive hype where the same show made by say Hulu/Amazon would get trashed.

Its like going to a store/library where everything is completely randomized every visit, you have no idea where things are, you have just one shopping list for all your life, and you have to rely on what's 'featured' and hope you'll like it.

edit - to make it clear, this applies to their apps UI. The website is more full featured but even that has reduced functionality compared to before.

Another thing people don't realize - Netflix is described (by themselves) as a data analytics platform with streaming as a side effect.

The real reason you actually lost subscribers???,"You didn't 'lose' subscribers to 'password sharing'. You didn't 'lose subscribers' to 'competition'. You lost me, and I'm sure many others, because you introduced crazy expensive pricing if we want to watch anything other than non HD (let alone 4k) tv on anything other than one or 2 devices!

Disney+? Prime Video (which comes with benefit of prime delivery)? HBO Max (which alot get already with internet service or phone services)? They don't charge me more (yet) for 720 or 1080, and I can watch them anywhere on as many devices as I want. I cancelled last year because I wasn't home for a while, but when I decided to look into getting Netflix again, I was astounded how much it had jumped in price to watch anything other than non-hd streaming. I was looking forward to seeing the next season of Stranger Things, and if I was able to get it at 1080p for 9, or even 12 bucks like I used to, I'd probably renew now and watch it and some other shows, but with the current pricing model that is not happening.

Don't blame the consumers or competition for your loss in subscribers. Don't blame your content producers who are doing their best to make stuff for the audience. Look at your own practices and greed and there you will find the real reason your stock is now tanking.

&#x200B;

Edit: Um, wow did not expect this to blow up like it did, but thank you for all the comments. I just want to say I am still a big fan of certain Netflix shows, and If they were to introduce a $10.00 HD service with VERY limited ads I might be interested in that. So long as its not the exact same 3 ads every single time and they are VERY short.

Also I do realize that some of their losses were incurred due to shutting down Russian accounts, and I do know that they are still cheaper than a cable tv subscription. That being said, I think a majority of their Q1 2022 issues stem from the fact that alot of people have realized with their constant rate increases that sooner rather than later we would have been paying nearly the same for Netflix as we did for the cable services.

As far as all the people talking about the 'wokeness' of this or that, or any left OR right political stuff, I don't care either way.

Too Hot To Handle is annoying as fuck. Get this show out of my feed.,"Just because I watch Terrace House, doesn't mean I'm into soft core porn here. I don't want it to be on my front page with its incredibly seductive pics and aggressive ad auto play on the front page. I wanna watch the content I like without this rubbish trying to lure me.

It's like having Pornhub be right next to YouTube. Or having a porn video be right next door to a documentary video. Ofcourse, I'm attracted and it becomes hard to resist without post-nut clarity, but I don't want that in the first place. Just get it off my feed. 

Anyone here knows how to solve me case efficiently? Something like blocking it from ever showing if that's a thing?

You really should watch The Queen's Gambit,"I just finished the series in less than 2 days and I loved every minute of it and I think you'd love it too.

Honestly it's one of the best netflix originals ever and clearly the best of the year. There are several reasons for that. Its subject can be pretty surprising and off-putting to some (not me though, always loved chess so I was intrigued from the start!) but it's handled with such talent and efficiency that even if you don't even know the rules, you won't get bored. The chess matches are so well done and are genuinely exciting but that's also because there is so much more to it. It's a story about resilience and trusting yourself and become the master of your own fate, which, granted, sounds a bit cheesy but honestly.. it's just very inspiring. They also touch on so many other subjects with class, subtlety and restraint and it's just delightful and drives the point home.

Everything about her story is interesting and captivating and the excellent Anya Taylor-Joy (who I have loved ever since The VVitch) just makes the story shine. Her performance is stellar, with a heavy focus on attitude, facial expressions and body language which makes her acting so incredibly good and honestly ? Worthy of all the awards she could get. She's insanely talented the story really lets her flex her acting muscles and gives a nuanced and electric performance. 

The solitude she faced is perfectly conveyed through the directing, the music and her acting that it can almost be overwhelming. It can be pretty sad but they never overdo it.  It's genuinely beautiful and enthralling to see her progress through her career and form new connections and to see her relationships evolve. Nothing ever feels gratuitous, **the writing is superb. It's incredibly subtle and understated but it's so perfectly written that it just amplifies every emotion they want to convey.** The dialogues and the acting are **great** too. So is the directing, the photography, and the sets and costumes which are absolutely gorgeous. And the music.... the music is incredible, poignant at times, exciting and thrilling when it needs to be. **It is superb work they've done here**.

Honestly I could just go on and on about it, it's just a really great show. It's real and genuine and the ending might be the best ending to a miniseries I've ever seen ? It's beautiful and satisfying and **it just made me feel so good**, which I think we all need right now.",1604,0.92,197,te4rdr0p,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1604774350.0,False,False,False,2020-11-07 18:39:10,i just finished the series in less than days and i loved every minute of it and i think youd love it too honestly its one of the best netflix originals ever and clearly the best of the year there are several reasons for that its subject can be pretty surprising and offputting to some not me though always loved chess so i was intrigued from the start but its handled with such talent and efficiency that even if you dont even know the rules you wont get bored the chess matches are so well done and are genuinely exciting but thats also because there is so much more to it its a story about resilience and trusting yourself and become the master of your own fate which granted sounds a bit cheesy but honestly its just very inspiring they also touch on so many other subjects with class subtlety and restraint and its just delightful and drives the point home everything about her story is interesting and captivating and the excellent anya taylorjoy who i have loved ever since the vvitch just makes the story shine her performance is stellar with a heavy focus on attitude facial expressions and body language which makes her acting so incredibly good and honestly worthy of all the awards she could get shes insanely talented the story really lets her flex her acting muscles and gives a nuanced and electric performance the solitude she faced is perfectly conveyed through the directing the music and her acting that it can almost be overwhelming it can be pretty sad but they never overdo it its genuinely beautiful and enthralling to see her progress through her career and form new connections and to see her relationships evolve nothing ever feels gratuitous the writing is superb its incredibly subtle and understated but its so perfectly written that it just amplifies every emotion they want to convey the dialogues and the acting are great too so is the directing the photography and the sets and costumes which are absolutely gorgeous and the music the music is incredible poignant at times exciting and thrilling when it needs to be it is superb work theyve done here honestly i could just go on and on about it its just a really great show its real and genuine and the ending might be the best ending to a miniseries ive ever seen its beautiful and satisfying and it just made me feel so good which i think we all need right now,you really should watch the queens gambit,0

It’s shows like Squid Game that makes and keeps Netflix as the top streaming platform.,"It wasn’t that long ago that “traditional” television was shunning the streaming format. Fast forward a few years and a pandemic later and every company seems to have a version of their own streaming platform with millions thrown in to find an instant hit show.

They someone seem to open up the world and show that it’s not just English speaking shows that can shine. Before Squid game, there was Money Heist(Spanish), before that there was 4% (Brazilian) and before that Dark (Germany) to name a few.

"Netflix, if you’re going to increase the price. Make it worth it!!!","I’ve been with Netflix since the first year it came out. I’m paying €16 a month and now with the increase it’s €18! I’m from Ireland and the Netflix here is shit. They are really fecking pushing it. Especially since they keep constantly cancelling any show worth a damn or something different from the rest of the nonstop garbage we get. 

Sense 8 (least we got an ending with a movie), 
Marco Polo (I wish they ended this with a movie too), 
OA, 
Santa Clarita Diet, 
The Get Down, 
Away, 
Mindhunter, 
Glow?, 
Altered Carbon (Are you serious Netflix!?) Yeah the last season wasn’t as good as the other guy but it’s still entertaining and interesting. 

All these shows are great and yet I can’t even invest my time into anything on Netflix anymore because I just know it’s going to be cancelled. Only a matter of time before it happens to the  Witcher or Another Life or whatever other good shows are left
 
Also you’re movies are bloody horrible for the most part. Netflix has about 10 good original movies out of hundreds. And so many of the other movies are like 10 years old or just plain boring. Meanwhile Amazon got Parasite, Knives Out, Gentlemen, 3 Billboards, Green Book, 21 Bridges. And all of those movies came to Prime months after release. Best you can give us is Blackkklansman and Hotel Artimus? Yeah they are good movies but come on! Prime even has the hobbit Trilogy and you got rid of the LOTR. Least when Prime invest in something, you get your money’s worth whether they are good or not. 

Meanwhile your sinking money into garbage like 
The I Land, 
Warrior Nun, 
Ru Paul’s Drag Race, 
Adventures of Sabrina, 
Cursed, 
Adam Sandler movies and only 1 of them was good. 
And why the hell is every Netflix original movie so boring or just generic. 

Like I’m just saying. Make it WORTH IT! Otherwise why are we even paying for it.

Edit. I can’t cancel it because there’s 4 other profile belonging to my family and I wouldn’t do them like that. They love it but they haven’t seen most of the shows yet. I kinda completed Prime, seen all the shows on that, the Ireland Prime at least. I’ll be getting Disney+ After Winter soldier comes out and watch Wandavision along with it.

Then, sure enough, the minute she thought she had Barnett, she, without hesitation, gave poor Mark the ol steel toe. Then, when Barnett dodged that bullet, she went right back to her back up choice and explained she'd had a change of heart. What a joke. 

Then they go to MX and she cold-shoulders the guy the whole time because he's not tall enough and doesn't meet her exacting standards. Poor Mark found excuses for her and put up with it. All the while she's sucking down merlot, flirting with Barnett and bad-mouthing Mark to the other girls. My blood was boiling. 

Now they get home and she puts up roadblock after roadblock. ""We're 10 years apart (sigh -- this never ends), I wanna have kids tomorrow, Eeeek(!) he loves his Mom! He doesn't even make (gasp) $100K! I want a prenup!""

Took a peek a previous episode and it defaults to that when you press play? Set it as watched. 

Done with a season or don’t like a show? Set it as watched. Have Netflix give you a rating for it so it can (or can’t) recommend content like it.

"Netflix should add a ""timer"" feature to all content to alert viewers when the content will be taken down. [All]","I have had Netflix and used it for years. I am a big supporter and love the majority of the context that they provide as well as the ease of use that the mobile app provides. There has been one thing on my mind for a long time and I kept hoping that they would add the feature on their own, and that is a timer feature. Netflix often only has movies/specials/shows for a certain amount of time. Many times I see these items, might even add them to ""My List"" to watch later, and then when I go to look for them they have been removed. I understand that Netflix is not able to keep all content for forever and has to probably remove certain items that do not get a lot of views as is customary for other companies like Primetime stations who get rid of Primetime shows with little views. Something as simple as a ""30 day"" notice would be extremely helpful and would actually, as a scatterbrained viewer who watches tons of different items, make me focus on watching certain things before they are no longer available. Anything that Netflix could create that would be along these lines would be extremely helpful. The reason for this request is simply so that I and other users can utilize Netflix as best as possible and watch as much as possible. 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented and shared info. I did not expect this thread to blow up as fast as it did (I did not expect more than a few responses).

The Netflix Top 10 is so depressing,"Almost invariably, 70-90% of the Top 10 shows on any given day are shallow, superficial tripe. It's no wonder there isn't more quality programming. The majority of people actually *want* to watch this crap.

Squid Game ending...,"So I just finished this massively popular Korean series and truth be told, I enjoyed episode 1-8. Episode 9, the last episode, however did not sit well with me. Hear me out...  


1. Gi-Hun  (the gambler protagonist) did not follow through with his build-up and character arc - >!he was furious when  Sae-Byeok (North Korean defector) died right? That was the last straw that drove him to almost kill his childhood friend, Sang-Woo - but what was he doing for the last year wasting it away? Sae-Byeok's brother, Sae-Byeok's reason for living, was sitting in an orphanage for a whole year wondering where his sister was. Wouldn't it make sense if Gi-Hun adopted him in honor Sae-Byeok and helped Sang-Woo's mother out in the process? Why did it take him a full year? I get he was grieving the lost of his own mother. Gi-Hun was such an admirable and strong-willed character inside the games but when he finally got out, he ""lived like he always did"" and wasted the opportunity to honor and help out those who died during the game. !<  

2. Gi-Hun, as a>! terrible red-haired,!< father - >!twice he broke his own daughter's heart during her birthdays to his own selfish reason; did he just gamble AGAIN by going after the notorious group behind the game? Could his pride not take it at the expense of his loving daughter? If so, what was all that heroic act inside the game was for? And his driving force to survive the game (his poor daughter) was left again building disappointment on his father. I get that he didn't want anyone to be a victim of the games again, but entering again and fighting against forces you were very lucky to survive in is just against all human logic, at least think of your daughter, ey? !<  

3. Gi-Hun's pride and gambling addiction>! continues - even during the very last scene with the Il-Nam (the real antagonist) he was seen gambling a homeless man's life at the expense of betting all that he had on ""human kindness"" and was to proud to be proven wrong by Il-Nam. !<

Final thoughts ->! may be this is really the point of the series - Gi-Hun's addiction and how he still has it even after beating the system with pure luck and a lot of sacrifices. I'm sorry but that's a confusing way to tell a story. I was even rooting for Sang-Woo to win because he played the game better, whereas Gi-Hun was way too emotional. !<  


Let's face it, if you consented yourself for that kind of game, given similar dire situations as the players - you will do everything in your power to win.  And>! during those last minutes where he was boarding the plane to his excited daughter, I was like ""DON'T YOU DARE TURN AROUND, I SWEAR..."" and he did, I just felt his character arc was sabotaged right then and there. !<

A Series of Unfortunate Events is an example of how an adaptation should be,"I enjoyed the books very much when I was a child, and it taught me a lot about English as I am a foreigner. I was excited to hear about this show starting. I had not liked the Jim Carrey movie very much, but I enjoyed this adaptation immensely.

This show did an amazing job with adapting the elements of the book into the silver screen, and I felt like I was watching my imagination as a child all over again. Every episode was filled to the brim with the books, and it was very enjoyable to watch throughout.

The show was short, but I like that because it did not overstay it's welcome. It had a satisfying ending, and did not try to milk it for more seasons than it should be like so many other shows.

I genuinely believe that this show had no filler episodes, and other shows on Netflix should learn from this. They could have easily created 3 more seasons to get more viewership, but they chose not to. And I respect Netflix for that.

This is definitely the best show I have watched on Netflix in a while, and I hope Netflix follows this formula with their adaptations and originals.

Is Netflix ruining their reputation by canceling shows consistently?,"What really upsets me is Netflix is now making a habit (and a bad one) about canceling shows.

While I under people get paid money and have their own schedules, in the long run I think if an actor is approached by them, the first thought in their head is going to be “is this going to get canceled?”, followed by is this worth my time? 

I see more news on Netflix canceling things then about the company. I think in the long run some of these series will become cult classics, but user base will dwindle if Netflix starts to (or already has) created a reputation for canceling shows. Why invest my time and money into a app/company to watch something that will get canceled. You watch, the Witcher will get canceled in season 3-4.

This year Netflix loses 20% of its content (Disney & Fox Included),"https://www.recode.net/2018/12/5/18124117/netflix-media-companies-remove-content-charts

I like some Netflix originals, but usually not more than the big budget studio films and TV shows. I'm not sure how enticed I'll be to stay with Netflix once studios start pulling their content this year. This may be my last year, it may not be. I guess it depends on if Netflix ups their game on the content.

 I was disappointed with Bird Box and TV shows like Designated Survivor. I haven't found a Netflix made show I really feel beats the competition yet. Unfortunately I always feel the budget they have equals the quality and since these movies aren't released to theaters they suffer so much in quality.

EDIT: NBC just announced they will be adding their own streaming service in 2020. Which means they will most likely pull their content from Netflix possibly before then (includes The Office).

Netflix' search engine is absolutely awful. It should be revamped and it makes no sense to me and the order which things are recommended is just as bad,"So this is coming from someone who watches all kinds of shows but noticed it specifically when looking for anime on Netflix. When you search ""anime"" in the search bar you get ""suggestions on the side which will show genres related. 

First of all, the anime which it shows at the start aren't exactly the best and that's based on ratings. Code Geass is a great example to use, but it takes me scrolling through 3 of the suggested lists before finding it and it's rated at an 8.80 on MAL. And ignoring Netflix originals, why the hell am I seeing Flash and Rick and Morty before Code Geass. They aren't even anime. 

Then there's shit like Toradora, generally accepted great romance anime. I had no clue it was on netflix until I decided to write this because they would rather push me the same 12 shows in the scrolling function on my homepage so I ended up using a different streaming service to watch it a few months ago. 

I just don't get the order more than anything. Like I've seen Diabolik Lovers (ass), Akame Ga Kill (mid) and Danmachi (mid) at the top of damn near every list but at the very bottom is Neon Genesis Evangelion. It doesn't make sense! 

Last complaint relates to March Comes in like a Lion. This show is a top 10 anime of all time based on MAL Ratings. When i search the word anime I see it near the bottom.

I'm Deborah Feldman. The Netflix show Unorthodox is based on my memoir. AMA!,"Hello, Reddit! 

(Update 2: I'm back online, and will be logging on sporadically throughout the day to answer some more questions and follow up on some old ones. Thank you for your patience!

Update! I love your questions! There are so many of them and they are all great and my fingers are itching to answer them all. Unfortunately I have been typing rapid-fire for 90 min straight and have run out of steam. But I will be back tomorrow to tackle some of the rest! Thank you so much!) 

My book Unorthodox: A Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots was the inspiration for the new Netflix series. I was raised in the Satmar Hasidic community in New York. My marriage was arranged when I was 17 years old, and I had a son at 19. I left when he was 3 years old. I can tell you all about what it was like to grow up as a part of the Satmar Hasidic community, my escape, and my life in Berlin now, as well as what it was like to have a TV series made from my life story.

If you're interested, here's a NYT profile of me: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/arts/television/unorthodox-writer-deborah-feldman-netflix.html and an interview on WNYC's All of It with Alison Stewart: https://www.wnyc.org/story/unorthodox-true-story/.

"I really hate how at the end of a season, how Netflix make it difficult to watch the final credits in peace.","TLDR:
I'm really pissed that Netflix deliberately remove the ""Watch Credits"" button on the last show of every season because they want you to immediately start watching another series immediately. It totally kills the emotional atmosphere when I am in the middle of a big cry and the music ends abruptly. It takes me a lot to cry and I want to enjoy it in peace.

o---------------o


This is a message to Netflix - since they don't allow email:

I just finished watching Sex Education, and what I am about to say also applies to my experience of watching Schitts Creek.

It has become a big part of my life over the past weeks in lockdown. Thankyou for this great series. It caused me to fall in love with Netflix until something happened at the end of the final episode which has made me really angry with your company.

Normally at the end of each episode you default us to watch a preview of something else and we have to press ""WATCH CREDITS"" to stay with the current soundtrack, in order to integrate what we have just watched. It annoys me we have to press something in the middle of an emotional state in order to stay with the show we are already watching. 

Anyway, I can deal with that . . . but . . at the end of the FINAL EPISODE of the final season, you didn't have the ""WATCH CREDITS"" button and I was in the middle of a big cry when the music suddenly cut out and the next show started running. I now realise you do this at the end of every season....WTF? Why wouldn't you have the 'WATCH CREDITS' button again?

I AM SOOO FURIOUS AT YOU FOR DOING THIS!!!!

It feels like a deceitful trick to make us watch a stupid preview while we are in the middle of a vulnerable state. Well it certainly backfired on me!.

This is such appalling behaviour! You show no respect for our emotional state  in that moment. FFS let us watch the end of the final episode in peace, so we can honour the emotional state we are in.

Of course I'm going to watch more stuff on Netflix, but NOT RIGHT NOW!!!. I've just finished watching all the episodes, at least let me complete me cry!

This has really put me off Netflix. It shows you are just interested in commercial revenue rather than the authenticity of storytelling, and the emotional journey that it puts us through. It's also disrespectful to the artists and to the audience.

If you are going to have a link to the next show, at least make it an opt-in link, rather than the default that cuts off the final song after only 20 seconds. And the fact that you didn't have the ""WATCH CREDITS"" button like you always have had is super annoying. You had already trained us to press it, and now at the climax of the whole series, it's not there!!! WTF??

Yes, I finally realised that I can click anywhere in the screen to stay on the show but it took me three re-boots to work this out. I had long lost the moment of the important final sentiments of the show by then. It's all about the music, and when it cuts, we lose connection.

I know this stuff is all very much planned by you. There is a highly sophisticated science behind it, and it's all based on clicks and money, money, money, without care for us as audience.

You obviously haven't watched your own shows with any emotional depth if you can treat us with this level of contempt. When you do these manipulative gimmicks, you come across as super insecure that we are not going to stay with you unless we get the IMMEDIATE bridge to the next show.

This has left a very bad taste in my mouth about Netflix, and if I have a future choice to not subscribe to it, I will choose that.

\--

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not actually interested in reading the credits. I'm interested in staying absorbed in the MUSIC. Most good shows end the season by starting a great song just before the end of the last scene that plays for 3-5 mins during the credits. The intent is to give us integration space for our emotions to express and land gracefully after the climax of the ending.

A lot of work goes into crafting this music just right. If Netflix wants to show previews, they could at least be consistent and keep the WATCH CREDITS buttons with how they were at the end of the other episodes - so what we know what to do in the heat of the moment when we are immersed in emotion.

"""Shadow and Bone"" is a refreshing departure from crappy CW-style teen fantasy.","I was expecting this show to be cringeworthy teenage CW type stuff. There's definitely some cheesy romance and humor, but I was pleasantly surprised by:

1. The production quality

It's much better than many other Netflix originals. It's not quite The Witcher level, but it isn't as bad as something like Cursed or The Shannara Chronicles. There's some really creative use of magic ""physics"" in the environment, as well as some stunning cinematography. The CGI could be a bit better for sure, but this show definitely has imagination and makes it feel more convincing than everyone just playing dress-up.

2. Character depth.

I actually care about many of the characters and they seem to have interesting dynamics. The writing and directing isn't actually bad for budget fantasy, which is refreshing. The plot has remained interesting and I'm almost done with the first season, and I actually feel for some of the characters.

3. Fantasy

This show is for sure recycled fantasy from LOTR, HP, GOT, etc. but it at least executes in an original way. I like how they used GOT's story-telling technique where you just follow a bunch of characters on different, intersecting journeys. I would be looking forward to a second season, maybe even rewatch the first because there was a ton of lore I probably missed the first time.

Overall I think if show continues an upward trajectory, the second season could be almost as charming as a teen ""Witcher"" or some other well-done fantasy show.",1063,0.95,238,Jynx_2d,[META],2,False,False,text,self.netflix,1619403579.0,False,False,False,2021-04-26 02:19:39,i was expecting this show to be cringeworthy teenage cw type stuff theres definitely some cheesy romance and humor but i was pleasantly surprised by the production quality its much better than many other netflix originals its not quite the witcher level but it isnt as bad as something like cursed or the shannara chronicles theres some really creative use of magic physics in the environment as well as some stunning cinematography the cgi could be a bit better for sure but this show definitely has imagination and makes it feel more convincing than everyone just playing dressup character depth i actually care about many of the characters and they seem to have interesting dynamics the writing and directing isnt actually bad for budget fantasy which is refreshing the plot has remained interesting and im almost done with the first season and i actually feel for some of the characters fantasy this show is for sure recycled fantasy from lotr hp got etc but it at least executes in an original way i like how they used gots storytelling technique where you just follow a bunch of characters on different intersecting journeys i would be looking forward to a second season maybe even rewatch the first because there was a ton of lore i probably missed the first time overall i think if show continues an upward trajectory the second season could be almost as charming as a teen witcher or some other welldone fantasy show,shadow and bone is a refreshing departure from crappy cwstyle teen fantasy,0

How Many Of You Ignore A New Series Until You Hear If It's Being Renewed For Season 2?,"Honestly Netflix Is The Home To The Latest And Greatest Films And Series No One Can Deny This. But how many of you absolutely fall in love with all the new shows to only hear it's being cancelled? So after being let down over and over repeatedly (many of us are long time members) I honestly try hard to not get invested in any of their shows anymore. Perfect example the show ""Jupiter's legacy"" looked amazing but I skipped watching it for the simple fact that their may not be a season 2 and I HATE falling in love with a show for a measly 6-13 episodes. Netflix has a pretty large library of shows that appear from all around the world and I am sure many of you hear about these obscure shows through friends and family. Now that means a show may be on the server for a while before you hear of it because people are busy and what not but Netflix gives their shows these days like a month before they cancel them. This is ridiculous in my opinion. I am just venting my frustration. I was really hoping they made a second season to that show where the lady went to mars but sure enough cancelled. so many good shows seem to get the ax so quickly for some reason. So I am just letting Netflix know that they can't consider the amount of people who watch it right away as a way to measure the shows potential because I am sure there are many people like me who are just sick of loving a show to only get sucked in for 10 episodes then never know what happens to those characters.

How would you like to see a Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series?,I feel like Netflix is a fine platform to convert my most beloved comedy sci-fi books. The movie came out in 2005 and wasn't able to fully capture all of the great things that Douglas Adams thought up but I love it all the same. I think it is about time we get a remake akin to the early 80's show. I would even love if it were set in the 70's-80's.,992,0.9,145,untrustableskeptic,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1519089302.0,False,False,False,2018-02-20 01:15:02,i feel like netflix is a fine platform to convert my most beloved comedy scifi books the movie came out in and wasnt able to fully capture all of the great things that douglas adams thought up but i love it all the same i think it is about time we get a remake akin to the early s show i would even love if it were set in the ss,how would you like to see a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy series,0

Wow 13 Reasons Why got real bad and real irresponsible by the end,"I quite liked season 1, I thought it dealt with some pretty tough issues well, didn't glorify suicide or make Hannah Baker into a flawless heroine, and generally had a genuine level of intrigue into how each character fit into the central narrative.

By the end of season 4, literally every single character in this one grade of this one school has had some of the most earth-shatteringly terrible life events happen to them over the course of a couple of years. They all possess the most unlikeable hypocritical attitudes (don't get me started on Jess). We have this ludicrous situation with martial law and political rioting that I still can't quite fathom how anyone thought it was a believable story. One minute characters are on the verge of a mental breakdown or worse, and the next they are joking about the most trivial things. I think it's really irresponsible story-telling, especially with the world the way it is now.

I'm at that weird age where I'm too old to relate to modern teenagers now, but not old enough where my children are teenagers yet. So I'm wondering how impressionable high school kids could be watching this show, the show certainly gives the impression that they can act however they want with no consequences (including violence and vandalism) and that they should feel entitled enough to challenge every single thing that doesn't go their way in the most obnoxious, disrespectful way possible.

I really don't know why a stupid show made me so ranty, but I really really loathed the final season.

Edit: Great discussion, really interesting reading everyone's thoughts, especially about how impactful a show can be and the responsibility it needs to have in depicting real world issues/conditions vs it's a fictional show for entertainment and people know that while watching. 

The glorification of suicide in the show discussion has been argued a lot since season 1. My view on why I believe that it didn't glorify suicide is that it showed Hannah Baker didn't actually achieve anything in doing so. It screwed up her friends and family's lives and her attempt in highlighting how messed up sexual assault and bullying can be, did absolutely nothing in preventing either. The suicide scene was gruesome and troubling and the fallout was traumatic. All of that undone in the next 3 seasons though.",982,0.92,263,Cyvasse_Khal,[META],0,False,False,text,self.netflix,1591781613.0,False,False,False,2020-06-10 09:33:33,i quite liked season i thought it dealt with some pretty tough issues well didnt glorify suicide or make hannah baker into a flawless heroine and generally had a genuine level of intrigue into how each character fit into the central narrative by the end of season literally every single character in this one grade of this one school has had some of the most earthshatteringly terrible life events happen to them over the course of a couple of years they all possess the most unlikeable hypocritical attitudes dont get me started on jess we have this ludicrous situation with martial law and political rioting that i still cant quite fathom how anyone thought it was a believable story one minute characters are on the verge of a mental breakdown or worse and the next they are joking about the most trivial things i think its really irresponsible storytelling especially with the world the way it is now im at that weird age where im too old to relate to modern teenagers now but not old enough where my children are teenagers yet so im wondering how impressionable high school kids could be watching this show the show certainly gives the impression that they can act however they want with no consequences including violence and vandalism and that they should feel entitled enough to challenge every single thing that doesnt go their way in the most obnoxious disrespectful way possible i really dont know why a stupid show made me so ranty but i really really loathed the final season edit great discussion really interesting reading everyones thoughts especially about how impactful a show can be and the responsibility it needs to have in depicting real world issuesconditions vs its a fictional show for entertainment and people know that while watching the glorification of suicide in the show discussion has been argued a lot since season my view on why i believe that it didnt glorify suicide is that it showed hannah baker didnt actually achieve anything in doing so it screwed up her friends and familys lives and her attempt in highlighting how messed up sexual assault and bullying can be did absolutely nothing in preventing either the suicide scene was gruesome and troubling and the fallout was traumatic all of that undone in the next seasons though,wow reasons why got real bad and real irresponsible by the end,0

"Why does everybody complain about shitty Netflix shows? You don’t have to watch them, and they help Netflix make money to afford to take chances on amazing shows that might not have immediate widespread appeal.","**EDIT: Shit. That blew up. There were no responses and like one upvote an hour after I posted this, so I assumed it would get buried and went to bed. I’m reading responses now.**

^^^ What that says. If there’s tens (or hundreds) of thousands of people watching Fuller House (which can’t cost much to produce), and making Netflix lots of money, then they can afford to put out the weird shit. Or they can afford to lose money on the first two seasons of an amazing show that they know will pay off and pull in viewers in season 3 (and likewise they don’t need to dumb down the first season in order to get immediate ratings). This is one of the reasons that networks cancel amazing shows in the first season - because they don’t pay for themselves right away. Think about how many awesome Netflix shows would be cancelled if they were on network TV, just like Firefly!

I’m thankful that Netflix understands their market well enough to cater toward the different demographics and work the system. With all the shitty shows they release, it doesn’t seem to slow down the amount of amazing shows they release one bit. If anything, it accelerates the amount of “Netflix Originals” they’re able to put out, either with original content or by purchasing exclusive rights to great foreign series.

It reminds me of William H. Macy after he was in Jurassic Park 3. He said in an interview once that he takes on blockbuster roles in brainless films like that so often so that he can afford to make the movies that he wants to make.

The Good Place- Much better than good,"So I just finished watching the last season on The Good Place, and I am seriously changed by it. First off, funny and entertaining show. I believe I started watching when it was 2 seasons old, binged those, and had to wait for the next two.

I'm really writing this because of the 4th season though, and specifically the last couple of episodes. They were honestly the most contemplative and tear jerking moments I've experienced in a show/movie. I guess I'm not really sure what to say here, as I can't get into specifics due to obviously not wanting to spoil anything. But my god. I'm still feeling it the next day.

Rewatching a series should give you the option to reset time stamps as if you never watched it.,"TL;DR: Watching each episode until the credits (and it auto skipping) before deciding to rewatch the series actually messes up the timestamps of episodes that causes you to accidentally skip some. If you watch a series and each episode auto finishes, it should reset the time stamps or at least offer to do so for you to avoid confusion. 

 I know you can delete a series but it’s so much hassle and you’re just there to rewatch the show.

Anyways an example of how and why this bothers me. I want to rewatch Lucifer before season 5 drops. Episodes are super long so I watch one or two episodes every so often. Now I finish an episode and take a break but when I come back and continue, the credits are rolling and it takes me to the next episode. Without me realising, it’s skipped an episode for me since I technically already watched it. It’s also happened to another series I watch that has 20min duration (so I watch more back to back) and it confuses the hell out of me. I’ll be in the middle of an important story line and it skips an episode. I’m not paying attention to titles or episode numbers so sometimes I don’t know which episode I’m up to if it skips one. 

Few fixes: finishing a series that removes itself from your continue watching list also resets the watch time on every episode. It won’t erase the series tho so Netflix can still give you recommendations based on what you’ve watched.

Fix 2: once you finish an episode or the second you roll credits, it counts as a completed episode. Obvious issue is after credit scenes (Rick and morty) and the fact that watch time resets when you go next episode (but it’s inconsistent since I always use that). 

Fix 3: when you want to watch a series again (from the rewatch series tab or once Netflix knows u finished) it asks if you want to erase watch time. This is more invasive imo but just as effective as fix 1

"(US) PSA: Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut on netflix is the uncensored, unrated version that wasn't shown in theaters or as easily available on DVD","To get an R rating, they had to digitally insert people in front of couples during the orgy scene (who were doing *slightly* more graphic things) and for a long time this was the only version you could get in the US as far as I know. I just bought the unrated Bluray and compared a couple of scenes with the version on netflix - which is labeled as R rated - to see what the differences were. There aren't any. You can see the r-rated versus unrated side by side [here](https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=853344).

The downside is that the netflix version and the bluray I have are both widescreen.

Kudos to whoever is doing the networking and software at Netflix! Great buffering,"So my wife is watching a movie on netflix. I needed to reboot our router.

I head back upstairs and she says ""Have you done it yet?""

"Would Netflix ever consider bringing back a slightly more ""advanced"" rating system? [All]","I'll preface by saying I don't care about recommendations and how my ratings affect them. I always view everything that's been recently added and add to my list whatever looks interesting. 

But, I simply don't like giving ""good"" ratings i.e. thumbs up, to mediocre films/shows, which gives the impression that I liked a film/show as much as one I found amazing.. There's plenty of films/shows out there everyone has issues with, but that they still enjoy, to an extent.. For me personally, Suicide Squad and Sicario 2 are two random examples. I found them alright to watch, I didn't *hate* them, but I still had a hundred and one issues with them. Whether it be acting, plot, pacing, source-material etc. I in no way considered the films to be ""good"". But at the same time, I didn't have to stop them half way through. This would a perfect example of a ""meh"" rating or thumbs sideways, or something.. Films/shows that aren't that bad so long as you switch your brain off. 

I wouldn't be surprised if it's true that marketing teams use the analytics gathered from Netflix ratings, to deceitfully showcase a film/show as one that's highly rated by the audiences - when actually there's just no other rating options.. And I really hate giving random, mediocre films/shows like Bird Box, the same rating as a classic like American Psycho.

It also reminds me of the movie Inception in some ways. If you watched them both you probably know what i mean. 
Visually its freakin gorgeous and i think the score is fitting aswell.
It just keeps you in from the first episode.

"Netflix, please stop listing shows in reverse order.","Netflix, please stop listing shows in reverse order., or at least give us the option to change it ourselves. This seems like an extremely basic feature that should be available.

Watching the kids show ""Ridley Jones"" with my son today and it is presented with season 3 at the top, season one at the bottom. I get that they have this theory that with shows like this, it makes no difference, as there is no continuation of the episodes, but that's nonsense. We just saw an episode where she becomes an official protector of the museum, now several episodes later her Mum is talking about how ""She's not ready yet"". Sure, the stories don't closely continue from one to the next, but there is still character development.

I am enraged at how bad Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel is.,"Here’s just a list of the things that are infuriating me about this doc:

1. They have multiple “internet sleuths” as experts. Now, I’m all for the internet sleuthing movement, and I don’t mind them being interviewed if they played a roll in the case (like that don’t mess with cats show), but somebody just blogging about a case does not make them an expert.

2. Somebody said “I’ve spent hundreds of hours on this case.” So a week? You spent a week? So what?

3. Somebody else said they’ve spent hours on the case and disagree with the medical examiner. Jesus, who cares if you do.

4. Multiple people claiming she isn’t acting like she is bipolar because they haven’t seen someone who is bipolar acting that way before. Wow.

5. They are OBSESSED with the hatch being open and claim that’s proof she was thrown in. Um...why couldn’t she close it herself as she went in? Why is that deemed impossible and ignored? Is it more likely it would be left open in that case? Sure, but that doesn’t make the other option impossible.

6. Apparently the Cecil is a hell mouth. They act like evil is drawn there or some bullshit.

I love a Netflix doc drone shot as much as the next guy, but this is seriously one of the most unnecessary true crime docs I’ve ever seen. This story has been done to death before this doc, and if I can get the whole story in a 20 minute YouTube video, you have to give me a reason why you are making a 4 hour doc about it.

Edit: I wanted to say I posted this while starting episode 4. Spoilers, but for them to basically all admit it was probably just an accident and explain why EVERYTHING they brought up in episodes 1-3 was wrong really drove home the pointlessness of this show. I really liked how they handled the story of the musician though.

Edit 2: Those of you saying “you missed the point, the internet sleuths were bad,” you are giving this far too much credit.

If you go out to Hyehwa Station Exit 2 in Daehak-ro, there's a place that sells dalgona.

They are the ones who provided the dalgona(honeycomb) in the squid game.

There was an umbrella and a horror Younghee shape. (What a difficult.. i'm dead)

&#x200B;

Correction:

This dalgona was not actually used because it was thick.  
The person who actually made it at the movie set is another person who sells dalgona near here. 

That's in front of this coffee shop.

Netflix has too much content and not that many filter,"I don't have problem with too much content. Many people has and they are like ""Don't make it if it can't get 8+ rating on IMDB"". I am ok with too much content.

But Netflix don't have many filter option.

Like why I need to play the video too see if it is in English or not. Please put filter where we can filter by in which language show or movie is available.

Put some filter where we can see which shows will be outgoing and we can prioritize that.

Add rating if you think that is OK. I can understand that no one will watch low rated show and it might put show into even bad position. But people still can google. And good show will get more recognition and view. Your ""Most Liked"" is not enough. 

Put filter where we can filter shows by country or continent like East Asian or European or African or Indian. It will help us to see what other country makes and we can explore more content after that. Like after watching Kingdom all I want to see is just KDrama. The Russian show To The Lake is good but now I need to google things to see which Russian shows are available.

Please put English dub for at least Netflix OG show. Not all people will agree with it but I want to see shows in English as much as possible.

"In Netflix, subtitles for the hearing impaired often leave out important lines. It's maddening!","*TL;DR  Netflix captions were screwing up and showing only one line at a time. Four hours after posting this thread, I heard from them on Twitter and they have fixed the issue. Users can reset their devices to get the captions back.*

I wear hearing aids but still need subtitles for clarity. Fortunately for me, I can hear well enough to catch spoken dialogue most of the time, but I feel sorry for anyone who relies completely on subtitles. For people who are hard of hearing, it's aggravating to try to piece together what's being said from fragments. On Schitt's Creek, for example, there are spoken lines in the dialogue that are missing in the subtitles -- often the punchlines(!). Here are some examples from S5E1. The bracketed text shows lines that are spoken but left out in the subtitles.

FRUSTRATING!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Update:  Thanks to comments, I learned the difference between subtitles and closed captions, and in this post I was actually referring to closed captions but incorrectly called them subtitles. Thank you, u/ryetronics!

Another Update: I played the same episode on my computer rather than via Roku on my Smart TV, and the captions were correct. Does this mean it's a Roku problem? Is anyone seeing partial captions (one line instead of two) on any other players?

Does anyone wish that Netflix had a section where it was just streaming titles from its library like regular T.V.?,"For example: Let's say you go to Netflix. From there, you have their entire library to choose from. You can search through movies, T.V. Shows, you can filter by genre.

But what you can't do, is just flip through channels and see what's ""On"".

I would love a section, let's call it ""Netflix.tv"" that contains a few ""Channels"" playing a running stream of films/shows from the Netflix library.

There are some films that I've seen before I would almost never choose to watch given a huge library to choose from, *but* if I turned on my T.V., and it was 40 minutes in, I might watch the rest.  

This would also promote some of the lesser known/""B""-Movie content on Netflix. 

Sure, the show description/trailer might not have interested you enough to *choose* it over another film, but if it's on, and you don't feel like scrolling through thousands of movies you don't want to watch, maybe you'll give it a shot and potentially even enjoy it.

I may be alone here, but I don't have cable in my apartment, so I consume all of my television through streaming services. 

When I go home to visit my parents, there's something pleasurable about being able to just turn on the T.V. and something is just *on*, and I don't think that's just nostalgia. I think that the option of streaming is amazing, but I think there's also an advantage to the traditional style of broadcasting content. I would love if Netflix offered both.


Edit: For the people who are somehow interpreting this as a suggestion that Netflix *only* present content in this way, and change their current structure:

....What? How the hell is that what you take from this? Why the fuck would anyone want that? I’m asking for an additional service. 

Like you could click a tab and it would bring you to this. I don’t want videos playing on your home screen, or to not be able to choose what I want to watch whenever I want to watch it. 

A “live” stream of their content in a separate section of the website is not a complex idea y’all. Several other streaming sites do it.

 For those crying “But Ads!” I don’t really understand your point, because I don’t want them to change the way Netflix functions.

I am personally really disappointed in the cancelling of Cowboy Bebop,"I know tons of people liked throwing unnecessary hate at this show but I thought it was great. Even fantastic if you weren't being overly critical. 

The cast was perfect. The actors for Jet black, Faye and Spike were excellent.
Even side characters I felt were well cast. I found it more enjoyable than the original anime (trigger warning expecting people to shit their pants hearing this one) 

Mainly because the anime is over 20 years old now and is super dated, even I found the audio hard to listen to it sounded compressed and has really old sound effects, I mean the material is obviously great, a modern Bebop anime probably would be amazing. But I found it really hard to get into being so old. 

But I really liked this show and would probably put it in my top 10 of Netflix original shows. 

I mean John Cho IS Spike Spiegel, he will always be. Mustafa Shakir will always be Jet Black, Daniella Pineda will always be Faye 

Cho he's perfect, no one could do better. I'm sad I won't get to see him play spike (or the other main cast) again because some whiny articlers and negative fans had to complain. (More importantly hurt viewing data by not fully watching) If you don't like it just move along. 

I think it's the ton of negative nerds that put out stupid article after stupid article bashing the show and probably turning so many people off of it. I have seen nitpick articles nitpicking every damn thing about this show, the way they talk, the way they dress, how the anime is better, how it's just not good, how it messed up _______, and how some costumes were too different (while also some costumes were to the same, like wtf??  They said Faye to different, Ed to much the same) blah blah blah.

Netflix support asked me for my password,"In a pretty surreal conversation with a Netflix representative on their chat to fix a dumb bug, at one point the representative asked me for my Netflix account password.

I told him that the number one rule of online chat is to ""never communicate your password with anyone"". Things then took a creepy turn when the guy listed me all of the shows I've recently watched, the names of all the profiles (family account), all the devices used on my account and the last 4 digits of my credit card. Wtf?

&#x200B;

Is this normal? I would happily join screenshots of the conversation but it's in french.

&#x200B;

For context : I pranked my sister by ticking the ""KIDS?"" checkbox on her profile so she would only be able to watch kids shows (delayed shitty april's fools I guess). Except that it massively backfired when I tried to fix it and noticed that the checkbox isn't there anymore. This is when I decided to contact them and you know the rest of the story.

&#x200B;

EDIT : I then contacted them on the chat again and asked them to tell me why someone would ask me for my password and asked for an email address I could write to. The new representative told me that he couldn't give me an email address and that I should call them. I called them and the 3rd representative also asked me for my password in order to fix the bug I have on my account. Seriously, WHAT THE FUCK?

The show The Dragon Prince is definitely worth watching," 

This  show was written by one of the writters of Avatar The Last Airbender,  if you loved this show you'll enjoy the Dragon Prince too.

The  first season is kinda bad, the animations are horrible, some characters  are blank and the story is boring. But do not stop there because season  2 and 3 are MUCH better, the team did learn from their mistake and  greatly improved. The blank characters became very complex and you will  love them, the animations issues are fixed you won't have a problem with  it anymore and the story is interesting.

Season  3 started jumping around to different characters (kind of like game of  thrones) but it never felt jarring or out of sync. Also we finally saw  Xadia with beautiful magical landscapes and an elven golden city. The  characters arcs keep getting betters.

Netflix  took the show for 4 more seasons, this mean that now the creators are  sure not to be canceled and can start working on long term stories.  Season 4 might come in 2021.

I'm  writing this in hopes of turning  more people to giving it a try. It  doesn't get a ton of mentions and  talked about like other Netflix  shows. I don't want Netflix to decide to  cut it like it did its  superhero shows, before enough people find it  and give it the ol  college try. I want this show to do well. They  listened to fans after  season one and continue to push the series in a  great direction.

The success of Arcane makes me hopeful we could see more high quality animated shows for adults,"I've always wondered why most animated shows are comedies. Outside of anime, there is basically no adult animated shows for adults that tell an interesting story. Despite some minor flaws, Arcane is extremely well done. 

I think this style of show would allow some properties that would be too expensive to be properly adapted as live action to be created. After the first 3 episodes I instantly thought the Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson series would work extremely well like this. Likewise, a lot of sci-fi works could be done (J.S. Morin's galaxy outlaws would be great, and is already written almost as an episodic tv show)

MH370 Docuseries - What a terrible series,"I can really only blame myself for continuing to watch this sensationalist garbage.   
I know I don't like this style of documentary, one based more on opinion, speculation, and conspiracy than actual fact, but I was bored and it was the first thing I picked. 

First off the repeated theories.   
The Journalist who starts off the series with an entirely speculative, circumstantial frankly imaginative scenario involving the pilot and a play by play of what happened, bookended by 'this is the only way this could have occurred is if this sequence of events happened exactly as I described' (not verbatim)... righhhht  
He simply HAD to publish this theory, he exclaims how he has a responsibility, he must do this!!

Cut to some episodes later when the wider public are disagreeing with the notion of the pilot having anything to do with the mystery, coupled with data from the MRSAT, and a second Malaysian Airlines tragedy, new theories were coming to light.. and this journalist could not miss out on the action. 

He reappears to meticulously paint out his next scenario, an entirely different one to the first, whereby a couple Russians on the plane accessed the MRSAT, shut off the communications, and then... somehow.. were able to control the plane using the MRSAT...Again he says, he has to publish this!!

He embarks once again and a nice little self promo tour giving interviews touting his nonsense. Meanwhile those who actually know the ins and outs of the MRSAT start debunking key points of his theory, the key ones being

1. They have NEVER used the MRSAT data to track the location of an airplane before. This was the first instance of this occurring, which is pretty evident in how long it took to collate and translate the data.   
With this in mind.. why would these supposed Russians go to all this effort to turn of a machine that is inconsequential to them with minimal tracking capabilities. 

2. This machine stayed on for a further 6hrs after the main comms cut out, which speaks for itself. 

3. You categorically cannot control the flight of an airplane from the communications area in question, so again, whats the point?

The smugness of this dude touting his theories and using it to get attention, only for this to be given more attention with him as a key narrator for most of the series, spreading false information and conspiracy theories. 

This whole series is purely speculation by people who are more interested in fame and notoriety or at the very leas want to be 'the one' to figure it all out.

The reality is whatever occurred is a mystery to the general public and we may never know the truth. 

Whilst I don't have an issue with forming theories and ideas, especially surrounding such a strange and mysterious incident, it's only natural to want to form answers to gain some level of understanding. My issue lies in the sensationalism and platforming of these theories touting by specific bad actors and pulling the families back in to experience the grief all over again.

I’m not even done with BEEF and it’s so fucking good,"It has so much to say about how relationships and life affect people, anger, venting, coping, and all around any kind of mask and illusion. The amount of time Danny bottles stuff up, only for him to be so full he instantly gets angry from him overflowing. The amount of times Amy fakes a smile.

I’m 4 episodes in and absolutely love everything this show has to say. Absolutely amazing performances all around.

Edit: finished the show! What a finale. This show seriously made me think. We put up so many useless barriers, when all of us really just want the same thing, to be understood. Seeing Danny and Amy understand each other and them letting every guard down made me cry and want to do the same for my life. We’re all just human, let’s just be ourselves and stop shaming everyone else for the same mistakes we make. Everyone would be so much happier if we just accepted each other and stopped caring so much.

Edit: Didn’t expect this to blow up at all, would like to help support other well crafted film, so anyone who likes this show I would definitely give Barry a try. I finally gave it a try and it’s one of my favorite shows now and has a pretty similar feeling, although much darker and questions morals and asks when someone finally becomes irredeemable, along with how different kinds of people interact. Has amazingly well written characters, and lots of hidden meanings behind the comedy if you choose not to laugh and look for them. Great on rewatch.

[No spoiler] Midnight Mass is an incredible show,"First and foremost:

The pacing. Midnight Mass does not rush to the action. It builds up the setting and the deeply introduces you to the characters. The story unarguably is slow to develop, but it just work incredibly well. The way that pacing is approached here makes the setting and the series as a whole extremely immersive. It's a daring attempt in an age where series tend to rush to action and chain one  climax to the next in order to keep the viewer's attention. Midnight Mass doesn't rush and it doesn't need it. It is refreshing, I can't but think of the original Blade Runner which once left me with a similar feeling.

The story. I won't spoil anything here, but it's a unique twist to a long standing narrative. It works particularly well, because of the level of detail - and how some of the characters themselves have to be convinced of what is happening. It shows a fight of reason and conscience, versus the urge to clear their own conscience and their desperate need to rationalize what is happening to them.

The dialog and characters. The dialog is incredibly well written in a way that just feels natural. Episode 1 is a little bit on the weaker side here, but everything afterwards just seems so authentic. Especially the main cast is very well chosen.

Summary:

I went in, not expecting much. I was sceptic at first, but by episode three I completely mind blown. I haven't seen such an atmospheric series in ages. A horror series that does not rely on jumps cares or overwhelming gore, but manages to perfectly find that little spot in your head that sends signals of consistent unease.

A clear recommendation from my side.

# MINOR SPOILERS BELOW

In reply to another comment I think it is important to go into the show with the right expectations

&#x200B;

>The underlying premises seems to be that the people in the show do not know what a >!vampire!< is, a slight divergence from real Western culture where those stories were (and are) common. As they do not know what they are confronted with, they are trying to explain it with what they know - religion. They forcibly fit it into their framework of how they understand the world. Doing so, they rationalize horrible things, with just the right passages in their religious texts.  
>  
>To me it's the opposite - it's not stupid, but highly critical of society. Which is in line with the  more philosophical parts of the show.  
>  
>The talks about death heavily hint at lovecraftian horror, which focuses on the meaningless of the individual in the universe and the desperation that comes from realizing our own powerlessness. The show plots this feeling against the desire to have meaning and how blind we can become trying to find this meaning. How blind religion can make us with just a glimpse of hope.  
>  
>It was absolutely stunning and incredibly well made, but it's totally understandable that this kind of creeping Lovecraftian horror is very different from classic horror which focusses on provoking an immediate flight response (e.g., jump cares). This isn't what the show is trying to do, but what it does attempt to do it does phenomenally.

Why does Netflix only suggest shitty movies when they actually have great movies?,"When I look at the front page of netflix it seems it only has mostly shitty movies. I watch probably few of them, then I get bored and am thinking about cancelling.

However, when I search for a movie on google I often find out that it's actually on Netflix.

All awesome movies and none of them shows up on my front page until I explicitly search for them. Why the fuck do they hide them? Which makes users think Netflix only has shitty movies.
