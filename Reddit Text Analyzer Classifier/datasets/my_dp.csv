"Your thoughts on ""Strange World"" (2022)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b54u98yoq6nb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec81ccf094af3c4392ca0deab879b2b6ae88a1a2

**Overview**

*Strange World* is an adventure story that draws inspiration from old sci fi stories in pulp magazines, and movies like *Journey to the Center of the Earth* and *Fantastic Voyage*. It was a huge bomb at the box office (performing worse than Pixar's *Lightyear*), but I don't think Disney ever believed in it or cared about it, and their almost nonexistent advertising for the film bears that out. Affected by a number of factors (such as the public willingness to wait for animated movies to stream on Disney+, and the controversial presence of the studio's first openly LGBT character), Disney seemingly sent *Strange World* out to die and put all their focus into bigger contemporary films like *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* and *Avatar: The Way of Water*.

**Point by Point**

* *Strange World* opens with celebrated explorer Jaeger Clade and his tag-along son Searcher attempting to breach the mountains that surround their insular country of Avalonia, as no one has ever ventured past them. After a good-looking set piece in a collapsing ice cave, Searcher discovers a plant growing nearby that generates electricity (which Avalonia has not yet discovered and harnessed). Searcher wants to take the plant back to the people of Avalonia, but Jaeger stubbornly insists on continuing the expedition past the mountains, so the two end up going their separate ways.
* Twenty-five years later, Searcher and his family (wife Meridian and son Ethan) are farmers, providing Avalonia with crops of the electric plant (now called Pando) it needs in order to power society. Just as Searcher rejected his father's expectations for him years ago, however, his own son Ethan isn't so sure he wants to inherit the farm. The town is pretty and well lit, and the overall aesthetic really puts me in mind of Columbia in *Bioshock Infinite*.
* For reasons unknown, Pando crops all over are dying, so Searcher joins an expedition to find out why, and what can be done to save it. Pando is actually a singular organism deep underground, putting out tendrils all over the surface, and the expedition intends to travel to the “heart of Pando”. Predictably, Searcher's adventurous son stows away, and Mom follows both of them. There's also a three-legged dog named Legend who ends up getting into all sorts of endearing mischief.
* The world beneath the surface looks really good, and is populated with weird flora and fauna. Before long they discover Jaeger, who's been trapped down here all this time. This provides some opportunities for family drama and heart-to-heart chats, none of which is very interesting. There are some good action set pieces, however, including fights with the local creatures and a voyage across an acidic sea.
* Ultimately, the characters find out that their world is actually an immense, turtle-like creature, and that they've been traveling through its insides this whole time! Not only that, Pando is an infection that's killing the creature and must be destroyed! (A bit on the nose, I think. Avalonia's source of power is killing their world and they have to give it up? Okay, Disney, you first, but good luck running your amusement parks on just wind and solar.)

**In Conclusion**

*Strange World* is strikingly reminiscent of *Atlantis: The Lost Empire*. It's a low-key adventure story with gradual pacing, character development, and slightly more grown-up themes. I can't see young children being very captivated by it. Like *Atlantis*, I think it will be re-evaluated in due time. For now, I rank it Okay.

"Confused on my bundle, about the planned price increase, and the options to change bundles.","**SOLVED:**

Sorry for the lengthy post but I'm scratching my head on this.

&#x200B;

I signed up for the Disney+ bundle when it first started. Wanting Hulu no ads, I upgraded my Hulu plan to the ad-free plan. Never touched my accounts since then...

When I look at my Disney+ account, it shows I have the ""Legacy Disney Bundle"" for $15/month.

So right now, I'm getting charged $15/month when I check my Hulu account and $7/month when I check my Disney+ account. So total $22/month. So yeah I've been paying $2/month total more now than the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

Got the email from saying  ""The price of Disney Bundle Trio Basic will increase on October 12, 2023 to $14.99/month. The price change will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 12."" But I don't have that bundle.

...

When the increase happens, my Hulu plan will increase to $18/month (says when I check on my account page)...not sure what my Disney+ will charge me. If it's still $7/month, I'm fine with that since that equals the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

But if Disney+ will charge more then I want to change my bundle. BUT...i don't see any. Disney+ only shows option for Disney+ (basic for premium) and Hulu only shows option for Hulu (Hulu or Hulu (no-ads)).

"Your thoughts on ""Encanto"" (2021)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oczjugnzvsmb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=625b8cd76cf56861bad5f24a95e1d258486a5632

**Overview**

Released during the reign of COVID, *Encanto* enjoyed just thirty days of theatrical exclusivity before being released (at no premium) on Disney+. It found an audience on the streaming platform, however, and became widely successful and acclaimed, due in no small part to its hit soundtrack. It may not have been met with as much prestige and fanfare as *Frozen* or *Moana*, but I'd say its place among the Disney animated musicals of its era is assured.

**Point by Point**

* As usual, the visuals are amazing and colorful throughout. The opening song, 'The Family Madrigal', is a good way of introducing the various members of the clan and their special abilities. I did have to turn on subtitles in order to understand the lyrics, however.
* Grandma Alma has been through a lot. When her children were just babies, she and her husband had to flee some unspecified coup or revolution, and her husband was killed. The miracle occurred then, and created a safe place for the fleeing peasants to live. She's been holding tightly onto that ever since, afraid of it slipping away, and she's reached the point where the magic and the gifts have become the point of it all; the family must serve the miracle, rather than the other way around. She runs the family like a corporation, and applies her family's gifts and talents where she believes they'll do the most good for the community. Thus, the super-strong Luisa spends her days fetching runaway donkeys and holding up collapsing buildings, and Isabela – seen as the “golden child” - is pressured into an arranged marriage for the sake of more offspring with more miraculous powers. Meanwhile, Bruno, Alma's own son, ultimately chooses exile because his power to see the future is unpredictable and problematic.
* As the movie begins with young Antonio about to receive his gift (which turns out to be the ability to communicate with animals), we get a good look at how it all works. Each member of the family receives a huge, magical room (extradimensional in nature, as each room appears bigger than the entire house) that reflects their special gift. Mirabel, of course, never got one, and it's easy to relate to her. She overcompensates in her daily life, trying so hard to serve the family in any way she can, while feeling like she's less special than everyone else around her. Her song, 'Waiting on a Miracle', which she performs as everyone gathers around and celebrates Antonio, conveys the appropriate feelings of longing and disappointment. I really did feel sorry for her here.
* Luisa and Isabela both have great character development songs, with 'Surface Pressure' and 'What Else Can I Do?' respectively. I'm not sure why 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' was such a hit. It's just okay, it's no 'Let It Go'. Bruno is an interesting character, though, and likable; quirky, in a Jeff Goldblum sort of way. It's sad that he's been living in the walls for about a decade and no one has noticed.
* Mirabel's reconciliation with Alma at the river is a good moment. All along it's seemed as though Alma has regarded Mirabel as an emblem of failure and bad fortune, even if she didn't mean to, so it's nice to hear her give Mirabel some validation. She realizes now that she's been missing the point lately, and has been sacrificing the family to feed the miracle, but Mirabel reassures her in turn, pointing out that the miracle happened *because* of Alma.

**In Conclusion**

*Encanto* is fun, colorful, and dramatic, with good characters and good songs, and it handles the subject of a large, quirky family a lot more capably than *Meet the Robinsons* does. I don't quite rank it an S, but there's no question it belongs among the Greats.

**Overview**

A fantasy adventure inspired by a Southeast Asian aesthetic, *Raya and the Last Dragon* was the first WDAS film to be produced during the reign of COVID. As such, it was released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ (albeit at a $30 premium). Because of these circumstances beyond its control, and despite good reviews, *Raya* became one of the lowest-grossing WDAS movies of the past twenty years, with only *Treasure Planet* and *Winnie the Pooh* having grossed less during that time.

**Point by Point**

* As we've come to expect, *Raya and the Last Dragon* is a great-looking movie; WDAS rarely disappoints when it comes to visuals. The world in which it takes place boasts a diverse array of landscapes, all of which are rendered appealingly, and the animation is wonderfully fluid. I like the design of Sisu; she has some typical characteristics of an Asian dragon, but is covered with fur instead of scales, and her face is more mammalian than reptilian. The filmmakers did a good job crafting a look that sets Sisu apart from other cinematic dragons and makes her compelling to look at.
* Okay, so, the land is divided into five fiercely competitive tribes, with one of those tribes guarding a mystical “dragon gem” responsible for holding at bay an ancient evil called the Druun. The gem is coveted by the other tribes, and, during a diplomatic summit, an attempt to steal it results in its breaking into five pieces. This, in turn, results in the immediate resurgence of the Druun, whose main thing is turning everybody to stone. Each tribe seizes a piece of the broken gem and flees. Six years later, Raya is traveling the hostile land, searching for Sisu, whom she finally succeeds, inadvertently, in summoning. Together, they decide to reunite the fragments of the dragon gem. Princess Namaari of the Fang tribe – who tried six years ago to steal the gem and ultimately caused this epic disaster – remains an antagonist, and dogs their steps, hoping to acquire the fragments for Fang.
* The story has potential, but the cast of characters isn't particularly strong. Raya and her traveling companions – a boy who cooks, a fiendishly intelligent baby, and a brute with a heart of gold who seems like he stepped out of the tavern scene in *Tangled* – aren't very interesting or developed. We don't really learn anything about them or what makes them tick; just that they're sad about their loved ones having been turned to stone. Namaari, in particular, is desperately hard to sympathize with, because we've seen firsthand how she basically caused all this, and *still* she's the hardass of the story, working at the behest of her power-hungry, short-sighted mother. Sisu is fun and funny, and steals every scene that she's in.
* The main problem with *Raya*, even more than the bland characters and underserved premise, is the moral the filmmakers try to push. The story ultimately ends up being about trust, and how you have to see the good in people. The trouble is, the movie doesn't earn that moral at all. The whole fiasco happened because Raya and her father trusted people to not be terrible. Raya's father tried to get everyone together for the common good, but no, these degenerates decided they'd rather just fight and kill each other forever. Then, all throughout the adventure, Sisu tries to instill in Raya the importance of trust, but, when Raya decides to actually take Sisu's advice and trust Namaari to do the right thing for once in her miserable life, what happens? Surprise, surprise, Namaari is her usual, terrible self, and Sisu ends up dead; humanity's last hope, shot through the chest and knocked off a cliff.
* And then Namaari (and, by extension, the filmmakers) has the nerve to gaslight Raya into thinking that she bears equal responsibility for Sisu's death. Sorry, but no. No, no, and emphatically hell no. Namaari was the one who betrayed Raya's trust, then whipped out a crossbow, pointed it at Sisu, and curled her finger around the trigger. The tragedy is one hundred percent on Namaari's shoulders, and if Raya had killed Namaari in their duel afterwards, then it would have been justice served, albeit six years late.
* So, Namaari finally putting the fragments together by herself and banishing the Druun is supposed to be some sort of vindication of trust? Easy for her to finally do the right thing when it's literally her only option. The fact is, Raya was absolutely right not to trust Namaari, and was *proven* right. Yet the message the filmmakers seem to be trying to impart here is that you should feel obligated to keep giving toxic people the opportunity to stab you in the back until they finally decide it's in their best interest not to.

**In Conclusion**

I would have placed *Raya and the Last Dragon* among the Okays – its bland characters and lack of musical numbers rule it out from placing any higher – but the attempted moral message is so infuriating and delivered so badly that it makes me outright dislike the project as a whole. So, down to the bottom it goes, I'm afraid.

"Your thoughts on ""Frozen II"" (2019)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a8bjxoookllb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cf7ad8a4498d86a263c0c4bb7c924d41d2ea652

**Overview**

As phenomenally successful as *Frozen* was, a sequel was all but inevitable, and the talent behind the original movie returned to continue the story. *Frozen II* sees Elsa struggling with her destiny, being pulled in opposite directions between her role as queen of Arendelle and the allure of some enigmatic spiritual force. Meanwhile, Kristoff is making plans to propose to Anna, and Olaf has a new “permafrost” (the personal flurry Elsa gave him at the end of *Frozen* proved difficult to animate).

**Point by Point**

* *Frozen II* looks great, there's no denying that. The autumnal scenery (particularly within the Enchanted Forest) is gorgeous. I'm glad they went with autumn as a design choice. We've already seen plenty of lush, green forests in summertime, and, for the world of Frozen, the crisp, windswept days of fall strike a more natural note. There are so many excellent set pieces; the bleak desolation of the area surrounding the shipwreck; the scene with Elsa charging determinedly at the sea and wrestling with the water spirit; and the destruction of the dam by the earth giants, resulting in the huge tidal wave coursing towards Arendelle.
* The music, however, doesn't live up to that of its predecessor. I found most of the songs to be pretty drab. 'Into the Unknown' and 'Show Yourself' are the only standouts, in my opinion, and neither of them approaches the greatness of 'Let It Go'. Having said that, the 'Show Yourself' sequence is very impressive. The emotion on Elsa's face when she sees her mother is wonderfully captured, and so lifelike.
* I find the story of *Frozen II* mostly uninteresting, and it tends to drag. I do appreciate what the filmmakers do with Elsa's personal journey, however. Although it's not stated bluntly, it's pretty obvious that Elsa, at the beginning of the movie, is feeling unfulfilled with her life on the throne of a small kingdom. The insular world of Arendelle isn't enough for her, even if she doesn't know it yet. When she hears some far off voice calling her, she throws herself into the quest immediately, and, when she's forced to use her powers to overcome the angry spirits that greet her and her traveling companions, you can tell she's absolutely loving it. The scene where she's on her own, fighting the ocean and wrestling for her life against that water horse thing? That's all she's ever wanted. In the end, she makes Anna the queen of Arendelle, and stays out there. She's too big for Arendelle; too wild. Now she's free.

**In Conclusion**

*Frozen II* is beautiful to look at, has a couple of great songs, and gives Elsa a satisfying arc. Those things are what carry the movie for me. The whole package is definitely less than the sum of its parts. Instead of watching the entire movie again, I'm more likely to just watch 'Show Yourself' on YouTube.

**Overview**

WDAS movies don't often receive sequels. At this point in time, *The Rescuers* had been the only one to do so. The makers of *Wreck-It Ralph* evidently believed they had more to say, however, so, in this latest adventure, Ralph and Vanellope have to use the arcade's new Wi-Fi router to enter the Internet and find a replacement part for Vanellope's *Sugar Rush* game before it's scrapped. This gives the filmmakers the opportunity to comment on Internet culture and phenomena, in much the same way the original film explored the nuances of video gaming.

**Point by Point**

* The film starts off kind of slow, although we do get to enjoy some more cameos from video game celebrities like Chun Li and Sonic the Hedgehog. From the outset we're given a glimpse at the conflicts that will define the story; Vanellope is feeling bored and unfulfilled, and Ralph is displaying unhealthy attachment to her. Things pick up a bit when they finally make it onto the Internet. The film's concept of the cyber world is a vast city, with Amazon, Snapchat, and Google embodied by mighty skyscrapers, and Internet users represented by cute little avatars. When they find out they need actual money in order to acquire a *Sugar Rush* steering wheel, they initially get into loot hunting, and are tasked with stealing a high-value racing vehicle from a semi-apocalyptic MMO called *Slaughter Race*. The owner of the car, Shank, isn't having it, but she does teach Ralph and Vanellope how to go viral for bucks instead.
* While Ralph is busy making an ass of himself for likes, Vanellope ends up on a Disney website for fans. 'Let It Go' rings through the air, and characters like Buzz Lightyear, Baymax, Iron Man, and Eeyore mill about. Then, of course, there's the Disney princess segment. I guess some people like it, but...I don't. I think it's really, really cringe. Like, embarrassingly so. I was embarrassed while watching it. (The scene at the end of the film, when they all join together to help rescue Ralph, is a bit better.)
* The story never really gets interesting, and is predictable throughout. Gee, I wonder if Vanellope is going to decide to stay in *Slaughter Race*. Gee, I wonder if Ralph is going to regret unleashing that clearly dangerous virus. Gee, I wonder if Ralph is going to learn a lesson about respecting boundaries. Even the climax is kind of blah, because it's just Ralph facing his own insecurities; there's no actual antagonist.
* And the movie ends with Vanellope going Turbo. She goes Turbo and leaves *Sugar Rush* for *Slaughter Race*. The whole point of *Wreck-It Ralph* is that you don't go Turbo; it causes nothing but trouble. Don't tell me the players won't notice Vanellope is missing from the *Sugar Rush* line-up; at the beginning of the movie, we see a player excitedly pick Vanellope because “she has the best super power”. Going by what we saw in the original *Wreck-It Ralph*, *Sugar Rush* shouldn't be long for this world with the princess of Candy Land or whatever permanently dropped out. But no, never mind the message we sold you in the first movie. Going Turbo is fine.
* All in all, *Ralph Breaks the Internet* doesn't feel like sufficient justification for bringing these characters back in a new movie. The premise isn't very interesting, and the examination of Internet tropes, while amusing for a while, ultimately wears thin. All of the emphasis on memes and Internet-based companies seems kind of crass and soulless; like it won't stand the test of time. The Disney segment, in particular, feels more like blatant self-promotion than cute fan service. And then, of course, there's the complete invalidation of the message of the original movie.

**In Conclusion**

Lacking in heart and substance, and heavy with self-promotion and commercialism, *Ralph Breaks the Internet* feels more akin to an animated movie one would expect from DreamWorks or Illumination, not WDAS. It's definitely one of their weakest films, down there with *The Black Cauldron* and *Chicken Little*.

I'm worried about the upcoming Percy Jackson series.,"Percy Jackson is a book series that means the world to me. I fell in love with it in High School and I've never really stopped being obsessed with it. It's in my Top 5 favorite Franchises.

So when it was announced it was getting an adaptation second chance in 2020 I was hyped. It was the thing that kept me going that year.

So now the trailer is out. We have a release date. Two days from my birthday in fact.

And a lot of that excitement is still there but there's also a fair amount of worry.

And no this has nothing to do with the fact Annabeth is black or Percy has red hair. Whatever. I don't care about that.

It's that...so much has happened in between the announcement and now.

Before Disney overdosed on Disney Plus content and started burning people out.

Before the writer's and actors guild strikes

Before the infamous Disney Plus purge that led to a lot of stuff getting removed.

Before Disney said they were gonna cut back on streaming.

Just..before a lot of stuff.

There's also something I've noticed. Content on Disney Plus that isn't connected to Marvel, Pixar, or Star Wars tends to have a Shelf life. Two seasons and that's it. And if you're lucky you get to stay on the platform.

Percy Jackson is in a unique place because it's based on a pre-existing property with a huge and devoted fanbase. But books aren't exactly ""Mainstream"".

I can't escape the feeling that this is...the precipice of change. The turning point for Disney Plus.

If it does well it could be the shot in the arm Disney needs. Something to get the masses tuning in for Disney Plus because, unlike Marvel and Star Wars, this show won't require you to know about the backstory in order to fully understand it.

But if it doesn't do well it could be just another forgotten Disney Plus show. A causality of Disney spread Disney Plus too far too fast. (I saw someone comment somewhere that they think if Percy Jackson hadn't finished filming there's a decent chance they would have scrapped it and I'm inclined to agree sadly)

And I don't want that for Percy Jackson. I don't even care if they don't do all the sequels and spin-offs. I just want them to at least finish the first book series.

I just gotta hope.

TLDR: I'm worried about the upcoming Percy Jackson show because Disney is not in the same place as it was when the show was first announced.

Sorry if I rambled too long or if I was too much of a negative Nancy. I've just had these feelings building up for a while and I wanted to get them out of my system.

Kicked Off Disney Legacy Bundle Plan,"I go to log in today to Disney+, and it doesn't work on any device.  Same with ESPN+, so it looks like there's a problem with the bundle.  When I go to my computer to log in, it takes me to a screen where it says to 'complete my subscription', but there's no button, so it's functionally a dead-end.  Can't even get into account settings.  

I chat with customer service where they say my account was cancelled and, sure enough, I look and my CC wasn't billed this month.  Thing is, I'm the only one with access, and I didn't cancel anything.  They inform me that my only option at this point is to sign up for another plan, effectively raising my price.  The legacy plan is only about $90/year.  The closest thing to that plan is either the Trio basic (154/year) or the trio premium (240/year!)  

I strongly suspect Disney did this as a way to force me onto a new plan.  It's a legacy plan that they don't like, so they'd prefer if people migrated to more expensive plans, and they are saying I cancelled as an excuse to get me off of it.  Customer service rep is denying it, of course.  I've insisted they give me more details on the cancellation, since I didn't do it, and I'm waiting for a response.  Anybody else seen this?

**Overview**

John Musker and Ron Clements (directors of *The Little Mermaid*, *Aladdin*, and *The Princess and the Frog*, among others) return to deliver us another beautiful, musical extravaganza, steeped this time in ancient Polynesian culture and mythology.

**Point by Point**

* *Moana* just might be the best-looking WDAS film yet. Everything in it looks amazing, from the vibrant and colorful characters, to the lush vegetation, and especially the water effects. From the beginning of the film to the end, I was consistently aware of the incredible visuals. The music, too, is some of the best in the studio's canon, with songs that are inspiring, powerful, and catchy. The story isn't quite as meaty as that of some of the other great Disney epics, but it's never dull either, and is supplemented by pure, unadulterated spectacle.
* I don't go as greatly into detail on *Moana* as I do with the other Disney films. This is mostly because I have nothing but high praise for every aspect (no low points to speak of), and because *Moana* is so highly acclaimed and still so fresh in memory that anything I have to say would seem extremely obvious and commonplace. I love Moana's indomitable spirit, and she has real chemistry with Maui. Making the ocean an actual character was an inspired move, and the sequence at the beginning, with the ocean interacting with Moana as a toddler, is a great bit. The Realm of Monsters is an awesome set piece, and the encounter with the giant crab is mesmerizing. The initial, failed assault on Te Ka leads to a dramatic “all is lost” moment, where both the ocean and the spirit of Moana's grandmother actually let Moana off the hook, but, in an inspired reaffirmation set to soaring music, she presses on. The final encounter with Te Ka is spectacular, and the twist – in which Te Ka turns out to actually be Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart – is clever.

**In Conclusion**

All in all, I'd say *Moana* is probably the best WDAS film since the 1990s; even better than *Frozen* in many respects. The visuals, the music, the characterization, and the simple yet dramatic story all come together to form one of the studio's highest points. Definitely top tier material.

"Your thoughts on ""Zootopia"" (2016)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Disney's movie history is replete with stories of talking animals, but those talking animals are still living in the world of man. *Zootopia* embraces the concept of animals living in a world that's completely their own, made by them and for them. Disney's own *Robin Hood* would serve as inspiration. In *Robin Hood*, however, the characters don't actually behave like animals, or even really acknowledge that they *are* animals. Every character in *Robin Hood* (with the possible exception of Sir Hiss) could be replaced by a human being and nary a word of dialogue would have to be changed. *Zootopia*, on the other hand, really leans into the concept of a mass population of all sorts of mammals (strangely, there are no birds or reptiles living in Zootopia) trying to get along and function as a society despite their innate differences.

**Point by Point**

* The very first thing we're presented with is the stage play that young Judy Hopps and her friends put on for a talent show, laying out for the audience the dynamics of this society. It's explained, basically, that all animals eventually evolved into humanoids, and the carnivores (or “predators”) made the decision to stop killing the “prey” for food. Surely there must have been some kind of quantum enlightenment along the way, because why would the predators collectively go against their most basic, fundamental instincts and start eating...I dunno, veggie burgers? Protein supplements? Simply electing to let the prey be their equals in this society is an act of incredible benevolence on the predators' part.
* The sprawling city of Zootopia is marvelously and imaginatively conceived. It's not just a generic urban model filled with skyscrapers; it comprises several different habitats and ecosystems, from desert to rain forest to frozen tundra, each catering to the needs of its own population. (This suggests that terraforming and weather manipulation have come a long way indeed in the world of *Zootopia*.) Not only that, but the vast difference in size between animals is accounted for, and gerbils and mice can navigate the city just as easily as giraffes and elephants can.
* Judy Hopps is an extremely likable protagonist; indomitable and optimistic, even in the face of adversity and intolerance. She tries to make the best of being underestimated and assigned to parking patrol, but receives a rude wakeup call when she encounters Nick Wilde, a sly fox who hustles his way through life. Nick is a great character too, and the two of them share a good dynamic. Judy is significantly disenchanted during her second day on the job, but perks up when she has the opportunity to chase a thief through Little Rodentia, in a fast-paced but enjoyable sequence that showcases the juxtaposition between the small and the large. (To the tiny rodents living here, even Judy is like Godzilla.)
* The bit with the nudist animals is fairly clever, precisely because the animals don't look nude to us at all. Judy's cringing with embarrassment and covering her eyes feels completely unwarranted to us. (The area between the spreadeagled legs of the elephant looks unnaturally smooth, however. I'm pretty sure an elephant's genitals would be visible in that position.) The bit with the sloths at the DMV is hilarious, and undoubtedly a highlight of the film. The sequence with Mr. Big is good too, and feels surprisingly fresh, considering how often *The Godfather* has been parodied already.
* Judy putting her foot in her mouth at the press conference shows that even the best of us can be subject to prejudices and bigotries; it's not exclusively the province of mean people. We all have to be introspective. That's a valuable lesson for the kiddies. (It's not a perfect 1:1 comparison, though, because predators really are biologically disposed towards being killing machines. If anything, Nick is denying his biology by *not* eating Judy.)
* The investigation, throughout the film's runtime, is actually pretty basic and procedural, but the colorful, well-realized characters and the imaginative set pieces make it seem otherwise. Though Judy and Nick are doing little more than interviewing witnesses and scrounging for clues, the action is never boring, and it helps that the two play off of each other extremely well. The identity of the villain is a good twist (which seems to be a trend in this era of WDAS movies).

**In Conclusion**

*Zootopia* looks great, and has a lot of great characters and concepts, and delivers a good lesson about the dangers of intolerance and fearmongering. It's a fascinating world that I'd like to see more of. Fortunately, Disney has announced that a sequel is in the works.

https://preview.redd.it/k9jfe1dke0kb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0c4b71ba0b096cc5d3215d11146db34e9d32ef0

**Overview**

After Disney acquired Marvel in 2009, CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company's divisions to comb through Marvel's properties for adaptation prospects, and WDAS landed on *Big Hero 6*, a comparatively obscure comic book series set in Japan. More a reinvention than a proper adaptation (the characters and concepts of the comic book stories are dramatically different), *Big Hero 6* gave WDAS the chance to make its own contribution to the landscape of twenty-first century superhero movies.

**Point by Point**

* *Big Hero 6* takes place in a futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo called San Fransokyo. The blending of aesthetics makes for an interesting setting, with the hills and streetcars and Victorian-style houses of San Fran blending together with the neon skyscrapers, elevated trains, and cherry blossoms of Tokyo. It doesn't feel like just another generic superhero metropolis, and it's always interesting to look at.
* Hiro is a likable protagonist; a child prodigy who doesn't know how to apply his genius constructively, spending his time on robot fights. His brother Tadashi shows him his college research lab, where we meet Tadashi's friends and fellow students, and Baymax, whose soft, malleable form and consistently even temperament make him the breakout star of the show. His exceedingly gentle nature and genuine concern for his patient's well-being imbue all of his interactions with a warm, safe feeling that you can sense through the screen. (And the bit when he's low on power and acts drunk is hilarious.) It's fitting that Baymax – Tadashi's creation born out of love – is the one to come to Hiro's emotional rescue after Tadashi's untimely death.
* I'm...honestly not sure how we're supposed to respond to Hiro transforming Baymax into a warrior. Obviously, it's not what he was meant for; it's not what Tadashi intended. It seems a bit disrespectful, as though Hiro is missing the point. At the same time, Hiro is really just endowing him with a suit of armor and a knowledge of martial arts for defense; it's not as though he's giving him sword hands or laser eyes. All in all, considering the way the movie ends (with Baymax as a full-fledged superhero), it feels like we're meant to approve of the changes. For all the good that Baymax can doubtless do as a superhero, however, it's hard to ignore the fact that Tadashi's dream for him won't be realized, and that this “personal healthcare companion” has been repurposed as a soldier.
* The confrontation with the masked villain and the chase through the streets is a good action set piece. The way he manipulates the microbots to become thrusting tendrils is viscerally pleasing; kind of like watching Dr. Octopus in action. This sequence also brings Tadashi's friends to the fore, and we get to know them better. Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred are each dynamic and interesting in their own way, and, despite being just support characters, we get enough focus on them so that they don't feel superfluous. The montage (set to Fall Out Boy's 'Immortals', which was written specifically for *Big Hero 6*) of them adapting their tech interests into their superhero personas is a fun and energizing moment.
* Callaghan has an understandable motive for his wrath, but he comes off as pretty two-dimensional. It's like there's nothing to him *except* his wrath. He tries multiple times to kill his own students when they get in his way, and he expresses absolutely zero remorse for causing Tadashi's death. Was he *ever* a good person? Was he *always* this guy? I get the sense that he'd be willing to sacrifice countless innocent lives on the altar of his vengeance. He's presented as merely the one-note bad guy who exists to be overcome. Some greater nuance to his character and his behavior would have been welcome.
* In an intense moment, Hiro gives in to his rage and grief and reprograms Baymax to become a killing machine. In a jarring and abrupt transformation, Baymax's eyes go red and he lunges at Callaghan with a singleminded intent to kill, brushing the others aside like debris as he does so. I don't really have a problem with the morals of it (the idea that ""heroes don't kill"" is extremely simplistic, and counter to thousands of years of storytelling), but it's not what Baymax was made for. In the aftermath, when Hiro is still feeling low and he tries to access Baymax's chip port again, Baymax prevents it and, instead, shows Hiro an archived video of Tadachi. It shows that Baymax does have some agency.
* The climax is suitably exciting and action-packed, and I like Hiro's alternative plan for victory; never mind getting the mask, just smash all the microbots until Callaghan runs out of them. The inside of the portal realm looks good, and Baymax sacrificing himself to get Hiro and Abigail out is the emotional climax. (Fortunately, Baymax doesn't stay gone. That would have made the movie much sadder.)
* Frankly, I don't understand why Callaghan looks so glum when he's being bundled into the back of the police car. For him, the result of all this exceeds his wildest dreams. He got his daughter back. She's alive and well. He came here for revenge, and he was reunited with his daughter instead. He ought to be pleased. Of course, as I observed previously, I don't think Callaghan is characterized very well in general.
* And since *Big Hero 6* is, at its core, a Marvel movie, stick around after the credits for a cameo from Stan Lee!

**In Conclusion**

*Big Hero 6* isn't exactly one of the greats, and it's a bit simplistic, but it's a fun superhero adventure with some nice aesthetics and a touch of that Pixar-esque heart. Solidly good.

iger encouraged the companys divisions to comb through marvels properties for adaptation prospects and wdas landed on big hero a comparatively obscure comic book series set in japan more a reinvention than a proper adaptation the characters and concepts of the comic book stories are dramatically different big hero gave wdas the chance to make its own contribution to the landscape of twentyfirst century superhero movies point by point big hero takes place in a futuristic mashup of san francisco and tokyo called san fransokyo the blending of aesthetics makes for an interesting setting with the hills and streetcars and victorianstyle houses of san fran blending together with the neon skyscrapers elevated trains and cherry blossoms of tokyo it doesnt feel like just another generic superhero metropolis and its always interesting to look at hiro is a likable protagonist a child prodigy who doesnt know how to apply his genius constructively spending his time on robot fights his brother tadashi shows him his college research lab where we meet tadashis friends and fellow students and baymax whose soft malleable form and consistently even temperament make him the breakout star of the show his exceedingly gentle nature and genuine concern for his patients wellbeing imbue all of his interactions with a warm safe feeling that you can sense through the screen and the bit when hes low on power and acts drunk is hilarious its fitting that baymax tadashis creation born out of love is the one to come to hiros emotional rescue after tadashis untimely death imhonestly not sure how were supposed to respond to hiro transforming baymax into a warrior obviously its not what he was meant for its not what tadashi intended it seems a bit disrespectful as though hiro is missing the point at the same time hiro is really just endowing him with a suit of armor and a knowledge of martial arts for defense its not as though hes giving him sword hands or laser eyes all in all considering the way the movie ends with baymax as a fullfledged superhero it feels like were meant to approve of the changes for all the good that baymax can doubtless do as a superhero however its hard to ignore the fact that tadashis dream for him wont be realized and that this personal healthcare companion has been repurposed as a soldier the confrontation with the masked villain and the chase through the streets is a good action set piece the way he manipulates the microbots to become thrusting tendrils is viscerally pleasing kind of like watching dr octopus in action this sequence also brings tadashis friends to the fore and we get to know them better go go wasabi honey lemon and fred are each dynamic and interesting in their own way and despite being just support characters we get enough focus on them so that they dont feel superfluous the montage set to fall out boys immortals which was written specifically for big hero of them adapting their tech interests into their superhero personas is a fun and energizing moment callaghan has an understandable motive for his wrath but he comes off as pretty twodimensional its like theres nothing to him except his wrath he tries multiple times to kill his own students when they get in his way and he expresses absolutely zero remorse for causing tadashis death was he ever a good person was he always this guy i get the sense that hed be willing to sacrifice countless innocent lives on the altar of his vengeance hes presented as merely the onenote bad guy who exists to be overcome some greater nuance to his character and his behavior would have been welcome in an intense moment hiro gives in to his rage and grief and reprograms baymax to become a killing machine in a jarring and abrupt transformation baymaxs eyes go red and he lunges at callaghan with a singleminded intent to kill brushing the others aside like debris as he does so i dont really have a problem with the morals of it the idea that heroes dont kill is extremely simplistic and counter to thousands of years of storytelling but its not what baymax was made for in the aftermath when hiro is still feeling low and he tries to access baymaxs chip port again baymax prevents it and instead shows hiro an archived video of tadachi it shows that baymax does have some agency the climax is suitably exciting and actionpacked and i like hiros alternative plan for victory never mind getting the mask just smash all the microbots until callaghan runs out of them the inside of the portal realm looks good and baymax sacrificing himself to get hiro and abigail out is the emotional climax fortunately baymax doesnt stay gone that would have made the movie much sadder frankly i dont understand why callaghan looks so glum when hes being bundled into the back of the police car for him the result of all this exceeds his wildest dreams he got his daughter back shes alive and well he came here for revenge and he was reunited with his daughter instead he ought to be pleased of course as i observed previously i dont think callaghan is characterized very well in general and since big hero is at its core a marvel movie stick around after the credits for a cameo from stan lee in conclusion big hero isnt exactly one of the greats and its a bit simplistic but its a fun superhero adventure with some nice aesthetics and a touch of that pixaresque heart

Disney should now release all of the original movies and series they removed from Disney+ on physical media,"Now that Disney is making the remarkable decision to begin releasing its biggest Disney+ original series from Marvel & Star Wars on physical media, I think it is very important that the Disney+ original movies & tv series that were completely removed from the service get physical releases like this as well. 

As of right now there is no legal way to watch upwards of 76 movies & series that were exclusively made for the service. They have effectively removed all of the artists work from the face of the earth! Most of these had 4K releases on Disney+, but if Disney is concerned about spending a lot to release 4K Ultra HD copies of these movies and series, they should at the very least release them on Blu-Ray & DVD.

Will they all sell as well as the Marvel and Star Wars releases? No. But to at least having them AVAILABLE to watch is incredibly important to ensure that these productions are not erased from existence and to preserve them for future generations. 

What do you think about this?

This is the list of original movies and documentaries that were made for Disney+ that have been removed from the service since June:

- Artemis Fowl
- Better Nate Than Never

"Your thoughts on ""Frozen"" (2013)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

If there was any doubt remaining – after *The Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, and *Wreck-It Ralph* – that WDAS was back at the top of their game, *Frozen* must have obliterated it. With its resonant story, likable characters, and spectacular music, *Frozen* became a worldwide phenomenon, as any parent to a young child at the time would be able to attest. It made over a billion dollars at the box office (it held the record for highest-grossing animated film until 2019's *The Lion King*) and was the first WDAS movie to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

**Point by Point**

* Opening on the men harvesting the blocks of ice is an interesting choice. It doesn't really have anything to do with the story (aside from introducing us briefly to young Kristoff and Sven), but it gets us thinking about ice. Ice; it's beautiful and dangerous. Beware the frozen heart!
* Young Elsa and Anna are cute kids, and the snow and ice effects are magnificent, as they are throughout the movie. The king and queen mean well, but they fail Elsa badly. Even after the troll chief tells them that fear will be Elsa's enemy, her parents grab onto their fear with both hands and clasp it tight. They don't teach her to control her power, they teach her to hate and fear it. They teach her to hate and fear *herself*. I'm not a parent, so I can't presume to know how I'd react in a situation like this, but, from a detached perspective, the king and queen handle everything incorrectly from the start. (And what's up with those shackles we see Elsa wearing later in her cell? Her parents must have had those made for her and ready to be used. How messed up is that?)
* The story and themes of *Frozen* wouldn't be worth much without a good cast of characters. Of course, the film succeeds in that department as well. Elsa and Anna are both interesting and compelling, and Kristoff and Sven, when they show up, bring a good dynamic to the proceedings. Olaf is not only a brilliant and sympathetic font of comic relief, he's also a perfect demonstrator of Elsa's immense power. Not only has she plunged the entire region into an endless winter, but she's out here creating sentient life without even meaning to!
* *Frozen* is celebrated for its soundtrack, but 'Let It Go', now that's the showstopper; that whole sequence – with the creation of the ice palace and the triumphal change in Elsa's demeanor and appearance – is the highlight of the film right there. There's no doubt it's one of the greatest songs in the WDAS canon.
* After some fun adventures on the way to the ice palace, Anna confronting Elsa in the tower is dramatic and emotional. With Elsa declaring that she has to live a hermit's life, and the dueling singing between she and Anna, and then accidentally blasting Anna in the heart when she once again gives in to her fear and anxiety, it's probably my second-favorite part of the movie (behind the 'Let It Go' sequence).
* The scene with the trolls (and the song 'Fixer Upper') is a good diversion, and does some of the necessary work to get Anna and Kristoff closer to each other. Hans' heel turn might seem to come out of nowhere, although you can definitely pick up on some very subtle hints if you know it's coming. He's a villain, but he's not really *the* villain here. The real antagonist is Elsa's fear and her inability to control her powers; Hans merely takes advantage of all of that. Still, I think his role as would-be usurper is necessary, if only because it gives Anna a chance to sacrifice herself for Elsa, which she does in spectacular fashion.
* The climax on the frozen lake, with the blizzard raging all around, is exciting spectacle, with the best part being when Anna has to make the choice between running towards Kristoff to save herself or running towards Elsa, and chooses Elsa. What follows is perhaps the best subversion of the 'true love's kiss' trope, with Anna's ultimate sacrifice proving to be the act of true love required to break her curse.

**In Conclusion**

With its comparatively complex characters and story, and its magnificent visuals and music, *Frozen* deserves its popularity and prestige. It doesn't quite hit the same heights for me as the best Disney Renaissance movies (and that's probably only because I didn't grow up with it), but, of all the WDAS movies to have rolled out of the studio since *Tarzan*, it definitely comes the closest. My first thought was to file it under Great, but I have to ask myself, am I being nostalgia-biased? If I had been a child when *Frozen* came out, and if I had grown up with it, would I consider it a top tier Disney movie, worthy of standing alongside *The Little Mermaid* and *Beauty and the Beast*? Almost certainly. So, I'm going to make an allowance for my old fogeyness and let *Frozen* have a place at the top, where it most likely belongs.

the trolls and the song fixer upper is a good diversion and does some of the necessary work to get anna and kristoff closer to each other hans heel turn might seem to come out of nowhere although you can definitely pick up on some very subtle hints if you know its coming hes a villain but hes not really the villain here the real antagonist is elsas fear and her inability to control her powers hans merely takes advantage of all of that still i think his role as wouldbe usurper is necessary if only because it gives anna a chance to sacrifice herself for elsa which she does in spectacular fashion the climax on the frozen lake with the blizzard raging all around is exciting spectacle with the best part being when anna has to make the choice between running towards kristoff to save herself or running towards elsa and chooses elsa what follows is perhaps the best subversion of the true loves kiss trope with annas ultimate sacrifice proving to be the act of true love required to break her curse in conclusion with its comparatively complex characters and story and its magnificent visuals and music frozen deserves its popularity and prestige it doesnt quite hit the same heights for me as the best disney renaissance movies and thats probably only because i didnt grow up with it but of all the wdas movies to have rolled out of the studio since tarzan it definitely comes the closest my

"Your thoughts on ""Wreck-It Ralph"" (2012)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/naea0ubcktib1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dff7b52e818e01b92135bc817816ac022774de8

**Overview**

Using the medium of video games, *Wreck-It Ralph* explores what happens when the assigned villain of a narrative decides he doesn't want to be the villain anymore. Feeling insecure and discontented after thirty years of playing the heavy, Ralph sets out on a quest to change his destiny and gain the respect he craves.

**Point by Point**

* As in *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* and *Toy Story*, the filmmakers here were able to sprinkle in a generous assortment of licensed characters amongst the original cast, and, within the first few minutes, we're treated to cameo appearances by several video game icons. There's Bowser and Dr. Eggman; M. Bison and Zangief; Pac-Man and Q\*Bert and Frogger, among many others. There's no question this background population of recognizable characters makes *Wreck-It Ralph* that much more fun.
* It really is pretty shabby to throw a party for the thirtieth anniversary of *Fix-It Felix Jr.* and not invite Ralph. I mean, I get it, he's a big, clumsy guy, but you could have had the party outside.
* Determined to win a medal and prove he has what it takes to be a hero, Ralph infiltrates a first-person shooter called *Hero's Duty*, and is immediately overwhelmed by how “violent and scary” it is. We become more familiarized with the concept of video game characters as performers as we watch Sergeant Calhoun engage dramatically with the player, represented in-game by a drone equipped with a monitor. It's a neat concept.
* The world of kart racing game *Sugar Rush* (where Ralph ultimately ends up) is extremely well done; colorful and very attractive to look at, with everything made out of candy, cookies, and cake. Disney could have made a whole movie based on this premise alone. King Candy is a conscious homage to Ed Wynn, who, among many other things, provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in *Alice in Wonderland*.
* Ralph and Vanellope play off of each other well, although I didn't really sense quite the winning chemistry between them that the best Disney duos enjoy. The climactic race through the diverse environments of *Sugar Rush* is fun and exciting, and the stakes only heighten when the Cy-Bugs from *Hero's Duty* invade. King Candy turning out to be the demented Turbo in disguise is a good twist. In the end, Ralph uses his knack for destruction to save the day. In embracing who he is and what he's meant to be, he becomes the hero.

**In Conclusion**

I've been a video game enthusiast since the early 1990s, so I enjoyed the many cameos and references to real-life games. I couldn't get super invested in the story or the characters, however; it was fine, just nothing that really pulled me in. I enjoyed *Wreck-It Ralph* while I was watching it, but it just doesn't have that wow factor for me.

Is Star vs The Forces of Evil worth watching?,"I recently watched through Owl House and Amphibia (both phenomenal shows I can easily recommend) and when it comes to Disney cartoons this is one Im always iffy on checking out. 

I saw the first season and some of season 2 way long ago before season 3 started and thought it was fine. But I’ve never really had an itch to revisit and a big part of that is because of its reputation.

The best way I can describe it is if people say it’s a good show I’ve never heard why they consider it good. I’ve only ever hear people complaining about it. It’s not like Steven Universe where it has a large fandom that loves the show as well as a large hatedom. It’s only people complaining about it whether they liked it in the first place or not (from my perspective). Specifically when season 3 was coming out and season 4 only added fuel to the fire. I know shipping was a big part of that and I already know how that specifically ends because the official Disney YouTube channel spoiled for me when it happened.

"Your thoughts on ""Winnie the Pooh"" (2011)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

A Disney mainstay for decades, the Winnie the Pooh franchise saw a huge surge in popularity in the late 1990s with the release of the direct-to-video movie *Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin*. A slew of additional movies and TV specials followed (including *The Tigger Movie*, *Piglet's Big Movie*, and *Pooh's Heffalump Movie*, all of which received theatrical releases). With so much animated Pooh material out there, perhaps Walt Disney Animation Studios' own 2011 effort, titled simply *Winnie the Pooh*, failed to stand out. At any rate it received critical praise, but underperformed commercially. As of the present day, it's the last traditionally animated film to be produced by WDAS.

**Point by Point**

* The film opens nostalgically, with a reimagining of the look at Christopher Robin's room and the bouncy theme song featured in *The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. Like its forebear (no pun intended), *Winnie the Pooh* uses the storybook format; the narrator (John Cleese) converses with the characters, and the words on the pages become part of the action.
* The narrative takes direct inspiration from the stories of A.A. Milne; Pooh and his friends search for a new tail for Eeyore, and make plans to rescue Christopher Robin from an imagined monster. It's all very wholesome and good-natured, just as one would expect. The visual highlight of the piece comes when Pooh becomes so delirious with hunger that he imagines himself swimming in a sea of honey.
* There's nothing wrong, per se, with *Winnie the Pooh*. It's a perfectly adequate installment in the franchise. Nothing about it stands out, however; nothing about it suggests to me that it had to be a feature film produced by WDAS when it could have been a direct-to-DVD offering from one of the lesser studios. The story is just fluff, and none of the songs are the least bit memorable. And, at only sixty-three minutes, it's short.

**In Conclusion**

Of course, as an adult, I hardly represent the film's target audience. While most other movies in the WDAS canon manage to cater to broader demographics, *Winnie the Pooh* is decidedly for young children. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I do have to file it under the bottom tier of my personal ranking, however; even as a fan of Pooh in my childhood, this film simply didn't resonate with me. Again, not because it's bad, but simply because it isn't meant for me.

"Your thoughts on ""Tangled"" (2010)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

*Tangled*, Disney's long overdue adaptation of “Rapunzel”, marks the point where things really started to go right for Walt Disney Animation Studios again. It was in production for six years (it took them that long to get the hair looking right), and, to this day, is still the most expensive animated film ever produced. It was a critical and commercial success, however (which hadn't really happened for WDAS since *Lilo & Stitch*), and set Disney on the path to a new and brighter era.

**Point by Point**

* Though *Tangled* uses computer-animated graphics, the animators were keen to evoke the “warmth and intuitive feel” of Disney's classic, traditionally animated movies. The visuals are amazing; warm, bright, colorful, and full of light. Up until this more focused viewing of *Tangled*, I had never really appreciated how beautiful a movie in the computer-animated style could look. I had always thought of every movie done in this style – whether it be *Toy Story*, *Shrek*, or *Madagascar* – to look essentially the same. But now I can see that's not true at all. *Tangled* has taught me that a computer-animated film can look every bit as lush and magnificent as a traditionally animated masterpiece like *Beauty and the Beast* or *The Lion King*.
* As is usual for a Disney princess, Rapunzel captures my heart almost immediately. She's endearing, sympathetic, and bursting at the seams with hidden strength. Her long, long, *long* hair looks tremendous; it may have been an arduous labor, but the animators got it right. I love how it almost takes on a life of its own, and how Rapunzel can wield it as though it's a set of extra limbs; it doesn't get in her way or trip her up at all. She is its master.
* Mother Gothel is an inspired villain, representative of a subtle, insidious evil; the kind of evil that seems to love you and care for you, but only so far as it can use you to get what it wants. Gothel keeps Rapunzel in her place with gaslighting and emotional abuse, and, when she seems to do something nice for Rapunzel, it's only to keep her satiated and quiet. (Incidentally, how does Rapunzel know when her birthday is? The only possible explanation is that Gothel told her, but why would she do that?)
* Seeing Rapunzel experience being outside for the first time, after living her whole life as a shut-in, is an invigorating moment. That she also feels guilty about disobeying Gothel is a good bit of character exploration for her.
* Flynn takes Rapunzel to a tavern full of thugs and ruffians in an attempt to scare her off of her quest, but, as is her power as a Disney princess, she effortlessly charms the lot of them, and the song 'I've Got a Dream' is a catchy one. The action during the escape from the tavern is exciting, and Rapunzel using her hair's glowing properties to light their way out of the dark, flooded cavern is clever.
* Rapunzel and Flynn visiting the town during the festival is a good sequence. The little girls braiding Rapunzel's hair up for her is a cute moment, and the dance segment is joyful and energetic. The flying lanterns look really, really great; one of the most visually impressive moments in a Disney animated movie in a long time. And, as far as mood goes, I'd say that moment with Rapunzel and Flynn in the boat together is on a par with 'Kiss the Girl' from *The Little Mermaid*.
* Gothel's plan to gaslight Rapunzel back into her arms and win her everlasting trust and gratitude leads to the requisite “all is lost” moment, with Rapunzel back in her tower and Flynn awaiting the gallows. The way that Rapunzel comes to the realization of her true identity is a bit tenuous, but dramatic nonetheless. It all leads up to the climactic scene in the tower, where Flynn sacrifices his life to secure Rapunzel's freedom, and cuts her hair off. Gothel turns to dust, as she should have done ages ago.
* But wait! It looks as though not all of Rapunzel's healing powers were tied up in her hair. In what is surely a nod to the original Grimm tale, her tears bring Flynn back to life. Rapunzel returns to her parents and her throne, and all is well!

**In Conclusion**

The return to form for WDAS that began with *The Princess and the Frog* culminates with *Tangled*. Go figure that it would take a couple of princess movies to get Disney back on track; princess movies have always been their forte, after all. Welcome back, Disney, we missed you.

Disney Plus ended the Streaming Wars. We lost. The End.,"Excerpts from the article.

The more than 20% hike in prices means Disney+ will now cost twice the original price when the service debuted four years ago, and Hulu’s ad-free tier is now more expensive than the most popular Netflix plan.

Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCU and even Netflix have all raised prices this year in a drive toward profitability. And as Iger announced Wednesday for Disney, password-sharing crackdowns are also en route.

The announcement puts to an end much of the initial allure that led to the popularity of streaming. When Netflix first offered its pioneering service for only $8 a month, millions of people signed up, eager to have access to the company’s expansive catalog for just a fraction of the cost of the traditional cable bundle. That served as the genesis of the streaming era, with legacy entertainment companies such as Disney racing to launch their own direct-to-consumer products at unsustainably low costs.

Now that is all over.

Those massive libraries of content are growing more expensive (not to mention shrinking) by the year. In fact, consumers who bundle just a few streamers together in 2023 will find that the final cost is effectively the same as basic cable. Couple that reality with the introduction of ads into streaming and the end product eerily resembles on-demand cable.

It’s an ironic end to the streaming wars. After pouring billions and billions of dollars into constructing supposedly revolutionary streaming platforms, and decimating the business models that had offered the industry stability for decades, the ultimate product looks awfully similar to what companies and consumers were trying to break free from in the first place.

Can someone explain to me why many series are missing new seasons?,"There are a few series that are missing newer seasons and have been for years.  
The ones I noticed are the ducktales reboot (season 3 was missing for \~2 years), The Owl House (season 3 is missing) and Amphibia (seasons 2 and 3 are missing), but I'm sure there are more examples.  
It's like these seasons don't exist. (the on page season count excludes them)

And I simply cannot understand why. It's obviously some kind of region locking, since they are listed on US Disney+, but for me it just doesn't make sense. Region locking for streaming services like netflix is still stupid, but it makes sense, since netflix only licenses other media. But disney owns these series, so licensing can't be the reason. I can't see a single reason for disney to not show these seasons in my region, the only possible consequences are that less people watch them, or that they try to circumvent disney to watch them anyways.

"Your thoughts on ""The Princess and the Frog"" (2009)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m7po7jeay8hb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c77d5cfc074db63456c35db0c31e505da35a57a

**Overview**

A brief return to traditional animation, as well as a more lasting return to what makes a Disney animated movie feel special. Written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker (who had worked on *The Great Mouse Detective*, *The Little Mermaid*, and *Aladdin*, among others), *The Princess and the Frog* is a good ol' princess movie, visually evocative of classics like *Cinderella* and *Lady and the Tramp*, with the Broadway musical format of the 1990s films. It was a moderate success, but ran into its share of roadblocks; not only did it have to contend with James Cameron's *Avatar* taking the world by storm at about the same time, but it also struggled to draw male viewership. (Boys don't care about a movie with the word “princess” in the title.)

**Point by Point**

* The visuals are striking right away, with the warm, glowing pink of Charlotte's bedroom, and the movie looks good throughout, from the streets of 1920s New Orleans to the bright and colorful bayou, alive with detail. The part with all the fireflies lighting up the swamp is particularly good.
* Tiana is immediately likable as a protagonist, and her song 'Almost There' is a good one, with a visual flair evocative of the best Renaissance musicals. Naveen starts out shallow and lazy, but isn't unlikable. Even Charlotte, who is spoiled and pampered, isn't antagonistic. She could easily have become the wicked stepsister to Tiana's Cinderella, but the writers didn't take her in that direction. In fact, she's even supportive of Tiana finally marrying Naveen, when she'd had her own eye on the Prince.
* Dr. Facilier is definitely the best villain we've seen since the 1990s (although the competition isn't exactly fierce); he's stylish and well-designed, fun to look at and listen to. His song, 'Friends on the Other Side', is a highlight of the film. He seems powerful, but, in fact, all of his strength comes from his demonic benefactors. His desperation to appease them is apparent throughout the story, and his ghastly fate – being dragged down to hell when the demons have finally lost their patience with him – is perfectly fitting.
* *The Princess and the Frog* also boasts a couple of good comedic sidekicks in Louis, an alligator who longs to be a jazz musician, and Ray, a Cajun firefly who's in love with a star. They both do a good job of providing extra substance to Tiana and Naveen's adventure, and, in a sad twist, Ray actually ends up dying at the hands (or foot, rather) of Dr. Facilier. It's highly unusual for a comic sidekick to be killed off, but, in a magical moment, he appears to take his place as a newborn star beside his beloved “Evangeline”.
* Ultimately, when all hope of breaking the curse seems to have been lost, Tiana and Naveen are content to remain as frogs together. And it really does look like that's how their story will end, as they join together in froggish matrimony, in a swamp ceremony overseen by Mama Odie. In a clever twist, however, Tiana becomes a princess by marrying Naveen, and her kiss subsequently breaks the spell and returns them both to normal. A satisfying conclusion follows, with everyone receiving their requisite happy ending.

**In Conclusion**

*The Princess and the Frog* is a breath of fresh air after the mostly mediocre Disney entries that preceded it, and is a welcome departure from the era's dominant trends in animation; 3D visuals, acerbic humor, and rapid-fire pop culture references. It's a good ol' princess movie, full of music and magic; a welcome return to form.

"Your thoughts on ""Bolt"" (2008)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9k4y1es58ugb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=599f3c3966172afc5629ec56d1adcdae0b615651

**Overview**

*Bolt* isn't quite Disney at the top of its game, but it's definitely an indicator of even greater quality to come in the ensuing years; it's the dividing line between a dysfunctional and unremarkable past (*Home on the Range*, *Chicken Little*, *Meet the Robinsons*) and a brighter, more hopeful future (*The Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, *Frozen*). Overseen by John Lasseter, who had just been brought over from Pixar, *Bolt*'s box office was nothing to write home about, but it garnered mostly positive reviews, which, in itself, was something Walt Disney Animation Studios had been missing of late.

**Point by Point**

* Bolt is cute throughout the film; as a puppy he's *super* cute. We see him playing happily with his squeaky carrot toy when Penny comes in to adopt him. Five years later, Penny and Bolt are the stars of an action TV series! Thanks to the producer's avant-garde approach to character motivation, Bolt thinks it's all real, and that he really does possess super powers like super strength, super speed, heat vision, and a “super bark”. The destructive, action-packed chase through the streets of Los Angeles is a lively way to open the movie and introduce the concept, and, if you're unfamiliar with *Bolt*, then Disney has succeeded in tricking you too; you're going to get a movie much different than the one suggested by this intro.
* Sadly, because Bolt is meant to think that it's all real, he doesn't get to live the life of an ordinary dog. He doesn't get to relax and have fun. He's always anxious and on edge, always on guard against the bad guys who could be coming for Penny. (My nervous little guy freaks out every time someone walks past our apartment. I feel bad for Bolt having to live in that headspace *all* the time.) Penny doesn't even get to take him home with her; he has to live in a trailer on set. It's quite sad.
* Of course, the producer decides to film a two-parter that ends on a cliffhanger, with Penny in the clutches of the evildoers. This leaves Bolt frantic, and he doesn't intend to wait around to film the second half. He needs to rescue Penny *now*! In his attempt to escape the studio, however, he ends up falling into a shipping box and being rushed clear across the country to New York. Here he meets Mittens, a stray cat who's been running a protection racket on some pigeons. As Bolt is convinced Mittens is involved with Penny's kidnapping, she becomes involved in his quixotic trek back to Hollywood.
* It's fun to watch Mittens freak out while Bolt continuously tries to do “super” things like jump onto a speeding train or melt a padlock by staring at it. Eventually, however, Bolt comes to the tough realization that his powers are just Hollywood make-believe, and Mittens teaches him how to do normal dog things like begging for snacks and playing fetch. Along their way they meet up with a hamster (and super fan of Bolt) named Rhino, who provides additional comic relief. The song 'Barking at the Moon' is pleasant, if forgettable, and plays over a heartwarming montage of Bolt connecting with his inner dog as the trio travels across the country.
* Bolt finally makes it back to the studio, only to find himself replaced by a similar-looking dog. It wasn't Penny's idea; the showrunners insisted. To Bolt's eyes, however, it looks as though Penny's affection for him was as fake as his heat vision. It's a sad moment. Luckily, he doesn't labor under that illusion for long.
* Things escalate quickly after that. A fire breaks out in the studio and Penny is trapped. Bolt rushes in to save her. They try to get out, but Penny is overcome by the smoke and collapses. Bolt makes the decision to stay with her. Then he gets the idea to bark loudly through a vent, alerting the firefighters to their location. His “super” bark saves the day.
* Penny and Bolt retire from show business after this, and, in the Disney tradition of the family adopting the stray, Mittens gets to stay (and so does Rhino). The film closes out with a cute montage of Penny and the pets doing lots of fun things together.

**In Conclusion**

*Bolt* isn't particularly innovative or challenging, but it's a cute, heartwarming story, with lovable characters, and it feels like WDAS getting back on track after several post-Renaissance years of mediocrity. Particularly as a dog person, I liked it.

robinsons and a brighter more hopeful future the princess and the frog tangled frozen overseen by john lasseter who had just been brought over from pixar bolts box office was nothing to write home about but it garnered mostly positive reviews which in itself was something walt disney animation studios had been missing of late point by point bolt is cute throughout the film as a puppy hes super cute we see him playing happily with his squeaky carrot toy when penny comes in to adopt him five years later penny and bolt are the stars of an action tv series thanks to the producers avantgarde approach to character motivation bolt thinks its all real and that he really does possess super powers like super strength super speed heat vision and a super bark the destructive actionpacked chase through the streets of los angeles is a lively way to open the movie and introduce the concept and if youre unfamiliar with bolt then disney has succeeded in tricking you too youre going to get a movie much different than the one suggested by this intro sadly because bolt is meant to think that its all real he doesnt get to live the life of an ordinary dog he doesnt get to relax and have fun hes always anxious and on edge always on guard against the bad guys who could be coming for penny my nervous little guy freaks out every time someone walks past our apartment i feel bad for bolt having to live in that headspace all the time penny doesnt even get to take him home with her he has to live in a trailer on set its quite sad of course the producer decides to film a twoparter that ends on a cliffhanger with penny in the clutches of the evildoers this leaves bolt frantic and he doesnt intend to wait around to film the second half he needs to rescue penny now in his attempt to escape the studio however he ends up falling into a shipping box and being rushed clear across the country to new york here he meets mittens a stray cat whos been running a protection racket on some

"Your thoughts on ""Meet the Robinsons"" (2007)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Inspired very loosely by a children's book called *A Day With Wilbur Robinson* (to give you an idea of just how loosely, the book's story doesn't feature time travel at all), *Meet the Robinsons* is Disney's second fully computer animated film, following the commercial success of *Chicken Little*. Although WDAS had begun catering to more traditional visual trends in animation, *Meet the Robinsons* was a box office bomb, and is yet another Disney film of the 2000s relegated to obscurity.

**Point by Point**

* *Meet the Robinsons* focuses on an orphan named Lewis who also happens to be a brilliant inventor. After his latest invention destroys a science fair, he gets pulled into a time-twisting adventure and ends up meeting his future family - the titular Robinsons - in a society built on his inventions.
* *Meet the Robinsons* is a pleasant enough film, but not very remarkable. Lewis and Wilbur are both likable protagonists, but the story is a bit flat for a time travel adventure. The various members of the family Robinson are two-dimensional, and aren't given any time to shine. They're just set dressing. There's an octopus butler, a pair of twins who live in tree planters, and a superhero-themed pizza delivery guy voiced by Adam West, but none of them actually *do* anything. The twist - that Lewis is actually the patriarch of the Robinson clan - helps spice things up a little, but not much comes of it.
* Bowler Hat Guy has a good aesthetic going on; classic vaudeville, complete with black cape and twirly mustache. He's funny and colorful, but his partner in crime - an evil robot Lewis invents in the future - has zero personality. The revelation of Bowler Hat Guy's true identity is clever enough, but seems to come out of nowhere, with no prior hints or foreshadowing.
* Of course, everything wraps up well for everyone, and the ending is sweet and satisfying as Lewis' destiny comes full circle. It just feels like it ought to have more to it.

**In Conclusion**

I can understand why *Meet the Robinsons* failed to find an audience. It's not that it's bad, it's just...bland. There isn't a lot to it. The story and the characters have potential, but they simply never rise to the occasion. *Encanto*, years later, does a much more competent job of telling a story about a large, colorful family.

**Overview**

After spending the first half of the 2000s getting shown up repeatedly by Pixar and DreamWorks, Walt Disney Animation Studios decided to bite the bullet and produce its first fully computer-animated feature film. (*Dinosaur* had used mostly live-action backgrounds.) Reviews weren't particularly glowing, and it's too bad WDAS abandoned the traditional animation model, but, tellingly, *Chicken Little* was a greater commercial success than anything the studio had put out in the preceding five years.

**Point by Point**

* In this version of the story, Chicken Little's frenzied fears of the sky falling are debunked almost immediately, and he is made a local laughingstock. The core conflict here is that Chicken Little feels unsupported by his father, Buck Cluck, who didn't stand by him when he'd tried to warn everyone of the sky falling. In an attempt to make his father proud, Chicken Little joins the school baseball team. Against all odds (and the laws of physics), he scores a homerun and helps his team win the pennant. All seems well, but then...something falls from the sky and hits Chicken Little on the head.
* As it turns out, it's not a piece of sky, but of an alien spaceship. Things go off the rails a bit at this point, and there's a whole thing about the aliens losing their baby and invading Earth to find him, and Chicken Little's dad learns to be more supportive, and blah blah blah. There's really not much there. The story is extremely insubstantial, and the characters are wholly two-dimensional.
* With the newly 3D castle logo at the beginning of the film, you can see that Disney is really leaning into the new animation model. They also lean hard into the trends of the time. Animated movies produced in the early 2000s were expected to be rife with pop culture references, and *Chicken Little* definitely checks that box. In the film's first few minutes we see a clip from *Raiders of the Lost Ark* playing at a movie theater, and popular songs like Queen's 'We Are the Champions' and the Spice Girls' 'Wannabe' are performed by the characters throughout. Also present are the snide, unpleasant characters and crude humor typical of this era in children's animation. (The problem, generally speaking, was that the industry learned the wrong lessons from *Shrek*, frequently copying its cynical tone and sardonic humor while failing to recapture its genius and heart.)
* Oh, and just one more thing that I find a bit troubling. Foxy Loxy gets her personality completely altered by the aliens, and, despite their offer to put her back to normal, the big pig who likes Barbra Streisand is all like, ""Oh, no, she's perfect!"" and immediately takes her as his girlfriend. Does that creep anybody else out? I realize that Foxy was the typical mean girl, but we're talking about a child here. Whatever her comeuppance should be, I'm not comfortable with her being effectively lobotomized for laughs.

**In Conclusion**

*Chicken Little* is an embarrassment. Disney embarrassed themselves with this one. The studio that brought us *The Little Mermaid*, *The Lion King*, and *Mulan* climbed down into the mud to try to curry favor with the audience of *Shark Tale*, and the result is not pretty. The story is shallow, the humor doesn't land, and the characters are cruel and unlikable. I think I have more respect for *The Black Cauldron* than I do for *Chicken Little*. At least the makers of *The Black Cauldron* were trying to make something that would matter; at least they could go down with their heads held high and their dignity intact. *Chicken Little* is nothing but a cheap, cynical cash-in.

**Overview**

Throughout its development, *Home on the Range* saw many inventions and reinventions. The project started out as a coming-of-age adventure set against a cattle drive, then became a ghost story about undead cattle rustlers, then was reconceived as a story about a small bull who idolizes horses. In its final form, it's a comedy about three cows who become bounty hunters in order to save their bankrupt farm. The eclectic production history of *Home on the Range* is perhaps indicative of the mindset of Walt Disney Animation Studios at this time; Disney seemingly didn't know what they wanted, what audiences wanted, or what their identity looked like in a world where they had been bested at their own game by several rival studios.

**Point by Point**

* It's been quite a while since we've had a WDAS movie that I'd say was strictly for kids (since *The Rescuers Down Under*, maybe?), but *Home on the Range* simply doesn't boast anything to recommend it to adult viewers. It's a fun, zany adventure for children, but the story is weak, the characters are two-dimensional, and the humor is overly reliant on corny gags and referential nods (at one point, for no reason at all, a chicken quotes Tim Burton's *Batman*).
* I liked the three cows, I'll give the film that. I wouldn't mind seeing the further adventures of brash Maggie, flighty Grace, and prissy Mrs. Calloway. Unfortunately, none of the other characters were really compelling to me. Buck, the horse who dreams of being an action hero, is actually kind of annoying most of the time. Rico, the crooked bounty hunter, has no personality beyond being a Clint Eastwood type. And the villain, Alameda Slim, is unimpressive, with one of the most tenuous motives ever (he's a former ranch hand whose employers...didn't respect him enough, I guess?). Granted, the sequence in which we see Slim employ his Pied Piper-esque ability to hypnotize cattle with his yodeling is pretty good, with the psychedelic visuals reminding me of sequences from *Dumbo* and *Alice in Wonderland*. The film's finale is action-packed, though not very thrilling.

**In Conclusion**

*Home on the Range* is a bit of fluff, nothing more. Like most Disney animated movies of its era, it was a commercial failure and has since been relegated to obscurity. Some of its contemporaries, like *Atlantis* and *Treasure Planet*, deserved better than the hands they were dealt, but I can't say the same for *Home on the Range*. It's nothing short of baffling that this came out of the same studio that gave us *The Lion King*.

**Overview**

With an eye on the success of *The Lion King*, Michael Eisner put in an order for more naturalistic, animal-centered films. Needless to say, *Brother Bear* did not achieve the heights of that 1990s favorite; Walt Disney Animation Studios was still in the reeds at this point, struggling for relevance amidst more popular animated offerings from Pixar and DreamWorks. Like most WDAS films from this era, *Brother Bear* exists in relative obscurity today.

**Point by Point**

* As with most Disney animated movies, there's no denying that *Brother Bear* looks good, especially after Kenai has been turned into a bear and the backgrounds become consciously more colorful. The music is good too, although the return of Phil Collins sadly fails to recapture the lightning in a bottle that was the *Tarzan* soundtrack. The opening song (performed by Tina Turner) is sweeping and energetic enough to get the blood pumping, but the epic feel doesn't last.
* Kenai is irresponsible and not very likable at first, but, I mean, I get it. He wanted his totem to be strength or bravery or something manly like that, and then the old lady shaman tells him, in front of everybody, that his totem is love? I'd probably be disappointed too. As it turns out, Kenai has a lot to learn about love.
* The middle brother, Denahi, starts out with a more sensible perspective, if a tad unrelatable. (I freely admit that if my big brother had died saving me from being mauled by a bear, I'd be a lot less forgiving of said bear.) When he believes that Kenai has also fallen victim to the bear, however, he's fresh out of pacifism, and vows revenge.
* The bear cub, Koda, is cute and likable, and he and Kenai, during their journey to the salmon run, enjoy a dynamic similar to that of Shrek and Donkey. (Kenai is grumpy, and Koda won't shut the hell up.) The moose duo provides adequate comedy relief.
* It's a dramatic moment when both Kenai and the audience realize that the bear Kenai killed previously was, in fact, Koda's mother, and suddenly we're seeing the raging beast from earlier in a whole new light. Kenai's heartfelt confession to Koda feels a bit leaden, however, especially with the blandish Phil Collins song playing over it.
* The ending is pretty satisfying, with Kenai and Denahi reconciling, and Kenai electing to remain a bear for Koda's sake. I suppose this all shakes out all right because of the events that started it. If Koda's mother had initiated the aggression, then ending her would have been the right thing for Kenai to do. You don't need to feel guilty for protecting yourself and your family from a dangerous animal. All the bear did, however, was help herself to some fish that were freely on offer due to Kenai's negligence. Kenai's violent response was disproportionate, and led only to death and suffering. Now he's redeemed himself, and learned about love.

**In Conclusion**

I was nineteen in 2003, and didn't get around to watching *Brother Bear* until years later. As such, it dwells well outside the purview of my nostalgia. It's easy to be underwhelmed by a children's movie that wasn't part of your childhood. I fully acknowledge that I was not the target audience for this. Although it has its strengths (good visuals, mostly likable characters, a story with a moral), it's decidedly mediocre.

**Overview**

The concept of ""*Treasure Island* in outer space"" had been kicking around Walt Disney Animation Studios for years; directors John Musker and Ron Clements had been pushing for it since the 1980s. Though the setting doesn't do much to enhance the story (pretty much everything that happens in space in the movie could have happened just as easily on the high seas), the fanciful juxtaposition of tall sailing ships against the stars (and the period dress worn by the characters) creates an aesthetic not dissimilar to steampunk. Unfortunately, *Treasure Planet* was a giant bomb at the box office (it had to compete with Harry Potter, James Bond, and *The Santa Clause 2*), but, like *Atlantis*, it has since gained a greater appreciation among Disney fans.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals, as usual, are impressive. The animators set out to make a sci fi film with warm overtones, rather than dark and sterile and metallic, and I'd say they succeeded. The ships are made of wood, the solar powered sails are full of sunlight, and the outer space scenery is colorful, and characterized by bright, striking phenomena like comets and star storms. The characters themselves look good too, and cover a broad range of alien designs.
* Jim's skysurfing scene at the beginning is visceral and exciting, and is a good introduction to Jim's character. He's a problem child who's failing in school and frequently in trouble with the law. He wants to do better, though, especially for his mother's sake. Delbert is a good foil for Jim; a more responsible and grounded character to play off of.
* Of course, getting Long John Silver right is a key part of any *Treasure Island* adaptation. If you whiff on that, you might as well chuck the whole project. Luckily, this version of Silver - a charismatic cyborg with a multipurpose Roto-Rooter for a cybernetic arm - fills the role well. He's a likable  scoundrel who takes Jim under his wing and turns out to be more of a sympathetic rogue than an outright villain. His pet shapeshifter, Morph, provides the requisite sidekick antics.
* *Treasure Planet* really has only one song, but it's a great one. 'I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)' is a highlight of the film, and it has a place on my regular playlist. It plays over a montage that's partially flashbacks to Jim's early childhood and his father walking out on the family, and partially Silver teaching him how to be a sailor (or spacer, I suppose).
* The film slows down a bit in the third act, after arriving at Treasure Planet. I wouldn't say it gets boring, but it does drag its feet a bit. Things pick up again, however, once the characters discover Flint's enormous vault at the core of the planet; a terrific set piece. And there's Flint's cold remains, sitting at the center of it all, like a dead king. The loot of a thousand worlds, and what did he do with it? He stockpiled it here and then died counting it.
* And, of course, he rigged the whole thing to explode in case anyone found it; better to destroy it all than share it. Silver gets his moment of redemption when he gives up the treasure to save Jim's life, and their escape through the portal is an exciting climax. Of course, Silver goes free at the end, but not before giving Jim a handful of treasure with which to finance a better life for himself and his mother.

**In Conclusion**

*Treasure Planet* is a well-crafted adventure film, definitely one of the best Disney animated films of its era, and it deserved better than it got. It looks good, it's got a great song, and the characters are developed and voice acted well. The first decade of the twenty-first century was a rough one for WDAS, though. Children's animation was in the midst of a cultural flux, and contemporary films like *Shrek*, *Ice Age*, *Madagascar*, *Finding Nemo*, and *The Incredibles* were taking all the oxygen. We have a bit further to go yet before Disney would rediscover its footing. In the meantime, I'd place *Treasure Planet* solidly on my A tier.

Ranking All 61 Disney Films,"After coming from Disney World earlier this year, I wished to watch all of these films to just simply understand everything around me when I stayed there. This was quite a fun experience and eye opening experience.  I knew what most films would entail, but to actually see the full picture, it was nice. For the ranking, It was based on the idea ""would I recommend this to somebody?"" mixed in with my own personal opinion. And how my recommendations go, ""does it offer me something new?"". Just how I like to rank. I decided to rank all these films after watching all of them because I wanted to see how well they held up in my head.

&#x200B;

1. The Lion King - I can't simply think of a more perfect film that anyone can enjoy, no matter the background or language.
2. Beauty and the Beast - It's the perfect Disney movie, There's nothing more to say but watch it, also I love inside of the castle, backgrounds were amazing!
3. Aladdin - I think it set a whole new standard on how children's movies could be done, while just being all around fun. Also I'm middle eastern and I like the setting.
4. Lilo & Stitch - All the characters were great and you wanted to see them happy, love the setting, Hawaiian roller coaster ride is a fun song.
5. The Little Mermaid - I can understand people who rank it at first, it's great, I put a lot of the golden Disney films up high cause I can't think of any flaws about them. Ariel's animation is very expressive, that lead character animator should get a raise, colors are great and vibrant.
6. The Hunchback of Notre Dame - It grand, centering on one location is a novel idea for a film, and Esmeralda has a great design. Quasi Modo has an even greater design cause they had to make the main character hideous but good looking to watch. The gargoyles weren't horrible and are in Quasi's head, if he just has a giant cauldron of boiling water ready to pour on the guards climbing up its not impossible he did everything else just imagining the gargoyles doing it for him.
7. Mulan - Great message, love the China setting, weak villain that was not threatening in the slightest, Mulan is the only Disney princess with a body count, music is great, i like that scene when Shan Yu orders a sniper to kill the running away solider, and cuts with a cymbal playing.
8. Encanto - Best Disney film since Wreck-It Ralph, I love how beautiful the home looks and how much you explore through it, and the premise is great and well realized. Vibrant colors, great music, great characters, and I love the setting. I love it when films are set are drenched in a single country's culture.
9. The Jungle Book - The biggest surprise to me, cause I didn't expect much from it for being so old. Music is great, I love how small the story and setting feels. I think the message of Mowgli having to return to the man village is good although I can't put my finger on why funnily enough.
10. Peter Pan - It's one of the Disney films that just feels like a childhood fairy tail come to life. And surprisingly a boy in green tights and fights with a small knife is really cool to me for some reason lmao. I wish the Indians in the film were actually treated with more respect and not caricatures. I found the lost boys annoying. Music is too great, love those iconic visuals, and last thing, that whistle that announces Peter Pan's presence is so amazing.
11. Pinocchio - It's surprising how good of a film this is for their second attempt, Italy is cool.
12. Hercules - Such a great blend of the most bizarre things, I didn't feel the climax was all that suspenseful cause I didn't understand what made the titans threatening or if gods could even die or not. Music is fantastic.
13. The Emperor’s New Groove - It good, I remember catching this on the Disney channel a couple of times.
14. Wreck-It Ralph - Best Disney film that is not supported by being a musical, soundtrack is still fun though but I already like daft punk so its not hard. Gamer.
15. Tangled - I love how great this film is, but it doesn't do anything that exceptional, like it's just missing something to really put it in S tier. Flynn Rider is best Disney Prince. Rapunzel is best Disney princess. Rapunzel is the only Disney Princess with a negative body count.
16. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - I was a Winnie the Pooh kid and this is great, holds up well because the hundred acre woods feels like it's own world with it's own logic which i love. Ending the film with a segment about Tigger is a bit weird though.
17. Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs - It's a film that's mostly aesthetic and that aesthetic is magical. It's really unique how this film still holds up after all this time.
18. Alice in Wonderland - Fun experience, that idea about how eating and drinking could make you smaller or bigger was cool and I see why Burton used it more in the remake. I don't really like that one segment about a walrus wanting to eat fish though because it drags down the momentum of Alice wandering further into Wonderland.
19. Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The characters and their designs are great, they really know how to use the color blue, Mole is a fun character I enjoyed watching, the action was good.
20. Zootopia - It's cool, I's really weird the revival era has very little musicals(disney's best genre), it's a good mystery/adventure film.
21. Frozen - A movie covered by the music, Love in an open door is the best song, god I hate the fixer upper song because it doesn't further the plot of characters in any way. The concepts and premise are great but pretty underdeveloped. Hans is a good villain and great concept, but just undeveloped.
22. Tarzan - It fine.
23. Dumbo - Baby Mine is such a great song, it's one hour so doesn't waste your time. I like the rat he's a nice guy. You know, when thinking about the bad stereotypes in these films, with the exclusion of Fantasia, they all are characters that help contribute to the plot, so at least they're not all trying to be a mockery for the sake of joke.
24. Cinderella - It feels like a tv movie, what saves it is Cinderella herself being an engaging character, and evil Step Mother is devilish.
25. Treasure Planet - I like the relationship of Jim and John, although John's accent I can never get use to. Scifi/1700s aesthetic is neat, my god how did the captain and smart dog guy get into a romance??
26. Moana - It wasn't bad. Doesn't do anything for me, Water animation is great and fun character.
27. Robin Hood - Charming, Robin Hood is fun to watch.
28. Sleepy Beauty - Good animation, she has a blue dress actually lol, it's classic fantasy.
29. Meet the Robinsons - It's a good watch although a lot of characters are just gags. It's a movie only Disney could make, with that message Keep Moving Forward and moving on from failure.
30. Bolt - Have I ever mentioned how much I don't like dog movies? Well I do, but this one is good, I like the action scenes at the beginning and I wish more of these movies had flow like it. I only hear Hannah Montana's voice and also I hate that mother so much, the lawyer guy I once hated but he grew on me for being an absolute terrible person. That mother is worse, jokes in the movie weren't bad.
31. Pocahontas - A film without a climax but good animation tho, has two good songs.
32. The Three Caballeros - The disney movie I watched the most as a kid although beginning drags and it feels like a never ending party at the end. I love scene of Baia the most, and the dance sequence is catchy.
33. The Great Mouse Detective - It's a good film, probably should go higher but doesn't stick with me as much as others. Basil is a fun protagionst tho, villain is fun, climax is cool. Why is this lower than pocahontas again?
34. One Hundred and One Dalmatians - It's funny how the film is actually just a prison escape movie and that makes it better lol.
35. The Princess and the Frog - It's fine, could be better, could be worse, that firefly wasn't actually annoying as I remember, the movie isn't bad but nothing to write home about except the setting is a cool idea, man I wish New Orleans was a real place.
36. The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad - Watched this film at 3am cause I couldn't think of any better time to watch it and it did not disappoint, I love that line about the honest way, cracks me up all the time. Headless Horseman felt like I was a kid again at halloween, I love the segments between the two stories, cool set and funny line to end the movie with lmao.
37. Strange World - Most consistent out of the latest non-musical disney films. I liked the noses and character designs. Although I do question it's world cause why are there multiple skin tones if they all came from the same place? The ""strange world"" felt unorganized, i liked the twist but I feel that would make the characters have an existential crisis tho.
38. Frozen II - Nice animation, lost in the woods is great, why are you mentioning hans multiple times when he has nothing to do with the plot? Why do you keep referencing the original, it's like they don't trust me? It stole Bernard's plotline from The Rescuers Down Under.
39. Raya and the Last Dragon - It's pretty good if you exclude Namari's, Sisu's, and the core message's writing.
40. The Rescuers - I liked the main two rats, Bernard is so great, and the other girl one is fun to watch too. The secret society of international rats was a fun visual and Bernard dressed as Mario makes me feel whole. The little girl wasn't completely annoying.
41. The Rescuers Down Under - Pretty much the same experience as the first film, but John Candy is in this one.
42. Lady and the Tramp - I don't like dog movies but this had nice animation and one iconic scene.
43. Winnie the Pooh - This film exists. I did not expect that end credit scene.
44. Saludos Amigos - It was novel, pretty dated I presume since it's from the 40s talking about modern day culture lol. more Three Caballeroes ain't a bad thing. I love Jose, he cool.
45. Bambi - I liked how the villain ""Man"" wasn't shown and more of an effect from the world, like man is a part of nature. Turns out the reason ""Man"" wasn't shown is because of budget reasons lol.
46. Fantasia - Boring. But more memorable than 2000.
47. Fantasia 2000 - Better than the original, but not as memorable as t he original, I liked the celebrities and presentation between segments. I liked how each segment has a loose narrative to follow, helped make the film enjoyable to watch.
48. Big Hero 6 - Cool setting, first time Disney does a \*Japan setting, I love when Disney does an Asia setting!
49. The Fox and the Hound - Not bad but also not good.
50. The Sword in the Stone - I like it but it's more like a dvd sequel movie that's 3 completed episodes of a cancelled pilot thrown together.
51. Brother Bear - Gorgeous animation and backgrounds, neat story but idk, nothing to comment about it except I like the animation the most.
52. Oliver & Company - bad, Billy Joel exists and that is not okay, why should i worry is not bad and kind of a bop, I like the new york setting aesthetic .
53. Home on the Range - Not good, reminds me American history textbooks and maps from fourth grade with it's animation. Some jokes were kinda funny.
54. The Black Cauldron - The only disney fantasy film from the 80s, it has that small type of aesthetic  to it. It bad.
55. The Aristocats - I don't like this film. The dogs were so goddamn annoying, it's neat to have a french setting for once as I do like the country. The animation isn't that good, such a weird ending man.
56. Make Mine Music - It good, but wish inconsistent because not all segments are about music. It's weird how it isn't on disney plus? Also more Andrews sisters is always a good thing. That is a whale.
57. Melody Time - It fine, I now understand what the hell a Pesco Bill is and want to know why he has a restaurant in Frontierland.
58. Ralph Breaks the Internet - Awful movie that goes against the original's themes, and disney princess scene feels like the writers never even seen any of those films, like Rapunzel saved Eugene's life multiple times during the film.
59. Fun and Fancy Free - Wtf is this film?? It's so bad. Random live action, I want to kill Bongo, that ending gets off the rails so quick, Why do the puppets talk during the mickey short, why are their puppets, who is this man and why can't he throw the puppets into the fire place?
60. Dinosaur - I liked the when the logo showed up and opening sequence, i kinda liked the film, i surprisingly got use to the visuals quick enough. It wasn't a bad idea for a story but I don't really get the worldbuilding.
61. Chicken Little - Was awful in so many ways, but at least it's not the minions.",12,0.71,19,Lampposthead2526,:Discussion:

the gargoyles werent horrible and are in quasis head if he just has a giant cauldron of boiling water ready to pour on the guards climbing up its not impossible he did everything else just imagining the gargoyles doing it for him mulan great message love the china setting weak villain that was not threatening in the slightest mulan is the only disney princess with a body count music is great i like that scene when shan yu orders a sniper to kill the running away solider and cuts with a cymbal playing encanto best disney film since wreckit ralph i love how beautiful the home looks and how much you explore through it and the premise is great and well realized vibrant colors great music great characters and i love the setting i love it when films are set are drenched in a single countrys culture the jungle book the biggest surprise to me cause i didnt expect much from it for being so old music is great i love how small the story and setting feels i think the message of mowgli having to return to the man village is good although i cant put my finger on why funnily enough peter pan its one of the disney films that just feels like a childhood fairy tail come to life and surprisingly a boy in green tights and fights with a small knife is really cool to me for some reason lmao i wish the indians in the film were actually treated with more respect and not caricatures i found the lost boys annoying music is too great love those iconic visuals and last thing that whistle that announces peter pans presence is so amazing pinocchio its surprising how good of a film this is for their second attempt italy is cool hercules such a great blend of the most bizarre things i didnt feel the climax was all that suspenseful cause i didnt understand what made the titans threatening or if gods could even die or not music is fantastic the emperors new groove it good i remember catching this on the disney channel a couple of times wreckit ralph best disney film that is not supported by being a musical soundtrack is still fun though but i already like daft punk so its not hard gamer tangled i love how great this film is but it doesnt do anything that exceptional like its just missing something to really put it in s tier flynn rider is best disney prince rapunzel is best disney princess rapunzel is the only disney princess with a negative body count the many adventures of winnie the pooh i was a winnie the pooh kid and this is great holds up well because the hundred acre woods feels like its own world with its own logic which i love ending the film with a segment about tigger is a bit weird though snow white and the seven dwarfs its a film thats mostly aesthetic and that aesthetic is magical its really unique how this film still holds up after all this time alice in wonderland fun experience that idea about how eating and drinking could make you smaller or bigger was cool and i see why burton used it more in the remake i dont really like that one segment about a walrus wanting to eat fish though because it drags down the momentum of alice wandering further into wonderland atlantis the lost empire the characters and their designs are great they really know how to use the color blue mole is a fun character i enjoyed watching the action was good zootopia its cool is really weird the revival era has very little musicalsdisneys best genre its a good mysteryadventure film frozen a movie covered by the music love in an open door is the best song god i hate the fixer upper song because it doesnt further the plot of characters in any way the concepts and premise are great but pretty underdeveloped hans is a good villain and great concept but just undeveloped tarzan it fine dumbo baby mine is such a great song its one hour so doesnt waste your time i like the rat hes a nice guy you know when thinking about the bad stereotypes in these films with the exclusion of fantasia they all are characters that help contribute to the plot so at least theyre not all trying to be a mockery for the sake of joke cinderella it feels like a tv movie what saves it is cinderella herself being an engaging character and evil step mother is devilish treasure planet i like the relationship of jim and john although johns accent i can never get use to scifis aesthetic is neat my god how did the captain and smart dog guy get into a romance moana it wasnt bad doesnt do anything for me water animation is great and fun character robin hood charming robin hood is fun to watch sleepy beauty good animation she has a blue dress actually lol its classic fantasy meet the robinsons its a good watch although a lot of characters are just gags its a movie only disney could make with that message keep moving forward and moving on from failure bolt have i ever mentioned how much i dont like dog movies well i do but this one is good i like the action scenes at the beginning and i wish more of these movies had flow like it i only hear hannah montanas voice and also i hate that mother so much the lawyer guy i once hated but he grew on me for being an absolute terrible person that mother is worse jokes in the movie werent bad pocahontas a film without a climax but good animation tho has two good songs the three caballeros the disney movie i watched the most as a kid although beginning drags and it feels like a never ending party at the end i love scene of baia the most and the dance sequence is catchy the great mouse detective its a good film probably should go higher but doesnt stick with me as much as others basil is a fun protagionst tho villain is fun climax is cool why is this lower than pocahontas again one hundred and one dalmatians its funny how the film is actually just a prison escape movie and that makes it better lol the princess and the frog its fine could be better could be worse that firefly wasnt actually annoying as i remember the movie isnt bad but nothing to write home about except the setting is a cool idea man i wish new orleans was a real place the adventures of ichabod and mr toad watched this film at am cause i couldnt think of any better time to watch it and it did not disappoint i love that line about the honest way cracks me up all the time headless horseman felt like i was a kid again at halloween i love the segments between the two stories cool set and funny line to end the movie with lmao strange world most consistent out of the latest nonmusical disney films i liked the noses and character designs although i do question its world cause why are there multiple skin tones if they all came from the same place the strange world felt unorganized i liked the twist but i feel that would make the characters have an existential crisis tho frozen ii nice animation lost in the woods is great why are you mentioning hans multiple times when he has nothing to do with the plot why do you keep referencing the original its like they dont trust me it stole bernards plotline from the rescuers down under raya and the last dragon its pretty good if you exclude namaris sisus and the core messages writing the rescuers i liked the main two rats bernard is so great and the other girl one is fun to watch too the secret society of international rats was a fun visual and bernard dressed as mario makes me feel whole the little girl wasnt completely annoying the rescuers down under pretty much the same experience as the first film but john candy is in this one lady and the tramp i dont like dog movies but this had nice animation and one iconic scene winnie the pooh this film exists i did not expect that end credit scene saludos amigos it was novel pretty dated i presume since its from the s talking about modern day culture lol more three caballeroes aint a bad thing i love jose he cool bambi i liked how the villain man wasnt shown and more of an effect from the world like man is a part of nature turns out the reason man wasnt shown is because of budget reasons lol fantasia boring but more memorable than fantasia better than the original but not as memorable as t he original i liked the celebrities and presentation between segments i liked how each segment has a loose narrative to follow helped make the film enjoyable to watch big hero cool setting first time disney does a japan setting i love when disney does an asia setting the fox and the hound not bad but also not good the sword in the stone i like it but its more like a dvd sequel movie thats completed episodes of a cancelled pilot thrown together brother bear gorgeous animation and backgrounds neat story but idk nothing to comment about it except i like the animation the most oliver company bad billy joel exists and that is not okay why should i worry is not bad and kind of a bop i like the new york setting aesthetic home on the range not good reminds me american history textbooks and maps from fourth grade with its animation some jokes were kinda funny the black cauldron the only disney fantasy film from the s it has that small type of aesthetic to it it bad the aristocats i dont like this film the dogs were so goddamn annoying its neat to have a french setting for once as i do like the country the animation isnt that good such a weird ending man make mine music it good but wish inconsistent because not all segments are about music its weird how it isnt on disney plus also more andrews sisters is always a good thing that is a whale melody time it fine i now understand what the hell a pesco bill is and want to know why he has a restaurant in frontierland ralph breaks the internet awful movie that goes against the originals themes and disney princess scene feels like the writers never even seen any of those films like rapunzel saved eugenes life multiple times during the film fun and fancy free wtf is this film its so bad random live action i want to kill bongo that ending gets off the rails so quick why do the puppets talk during the mickey short why are their puppets who is this man and why cant he throw the puppets into the fire place dinosaur i liked the when the logo showed up and opening sequence i kinda liked the film i surprisingly got use to the visuals quick enough it wasnt a bad idea for a story but i dont really get the worldbuilding chicken little was awful in so many ways but at least its not the minions,ranking all disney films,1

"Your thoughts on ""Lilo & Stitch"" (2002)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qv1emiiniceb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ba9d1d5233c2062f4838e3deffae5ffd4fbfba1

**Overview**

Born out of a desire by Disney to produce something light and relatively inexpensive, *Lilo & Stitch* is a deceptively simple story about the meaning of family. Although it lacks the scale and production values of its contemporaries like *Dinosaur*, *The Emperor's New Groove*, and *Atlantis*, it became the most successful and probably most beloved Disney animated film of its era.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals of *Lilo & Stitch* are soft and appealing, using watercolor painted backgrounds, and suit the Hawaiian setting well. It gives the film a sort of soothing quality. The character designs are good too.
* Lilo is cute and funny, and she has a good dynamic with her sister Nani. They're both sympathetic and likable. Even Stitch is cute; I hadn't expected to find Stitch cute but, yeah, in the context of the movie, he's pretty lovable. He was created to be an agent of destruction, but he's also very smart. He can learn. Though he starts out just using Lilo to escape capture by his pursuers, he eventually gets to the point where he enjoys being part of the family. It's a sweet moment when he asks Lilo to take him out on the surfboard, despite his inability to swim or float.
* I won't lie. The moment where Stitch leaves the house with the Ugly Duckling storybook, and goes out into the woods to wait for a family to find him...that got me. That made me feel things.
* The fight at the house is a good action sequence (""Oh, good, the dog found a chainsaw!""), as is the finale where Stitch rescues Lilo from the shark-looking guy. Stitch's eloquent goodbye to Lilo and Nani after he's been captured is sweet, and demonstrates to the alien authorities that he's become civilized. The montage at the end, showing Lilo and Nani and Stitch (and also David and Bubbles and the aliens) doing lots of things together and being a family, is a really nice way to close it all out.

**In Conclusion**

I was in high school in the early 2000s, so we're well past the Disney movies that played their parts in my childhood. I'm much less familiar with the WDAS films of this era, and nostalgia no longer holds sway. As such, I really didn't expect to enjoy *Lilo & Stitch* as much as I did; I thought it would be kind of dumb and annoying; I thought Stitch would be like a Minion. But it's actually really well done, with likable characters and emotional moments. To my pleasant surprise, I'm filing it under Great.

**Overview**

The makers of *Atlantis* were passionate about their project, and a lot of care and effort went into it. (They even got the guy who invented the Klingon language for the Star Trek franchise to come in and create an Atlantean language.) It's a quality product, but it simply didn't resonate with audiences. Not only did it face stiff competition at the box office from *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider*, *Dr. Dolittle 2*, and *The Fast and the Furious*, but it had the misfortune of releasing a mere month after the smash hit *Shrek* had turned the business of animated movies on its head.

**Point by Point**

* The movie looks great, and has its own distinct style; more angular, lifelike but rugged, kind of comic bookish (which makes sense, as Mike Mignola, creator of Hellboy, was one of the production designers). It definitely carries an overall air of sci fi, and possibly even some Indiana Jones. The visuals may not appear as lush as those in *Aladdin*, *The Lion King*, or *Tarzan*, but I'd still say the film looks every bit as good as any of Disney's 1990s efforts.
* The characters are fleshed out, interesting, and mostly likable. There's a whole sequence during the expedition where the explorers settle down to camp, and they take the time to elaborate on their motivations and their personal histories. This isn't something you'd normally see in a Disney animated movie, at least not outside the context of an elaborate musical number.
* Speaking of things you wouldn't normally see in a Disney animated movie, how about that encounter with the Leviathan? The explorers' party starts out about two hundred strong, and then that thing comes along on the very first leg of the journey and just wipes out ninety percent of them! Good thing we didn't learn any of their names; that would have been time completely wasted.
* Atlantis looks magnificent, of course, and it's too bad Kida never got to be inducted into the heavily merchandised line of Disney princesses. Milo is a likable hero, and the supporting protagonists - the fast-talking Sweet, the tough tomboy Audrey, and the explosives-obsessed Vinny - are good too. Rourke makes a suitably slimy antagonist; the type who's probably crazy on the inside.
* All in all, *Atlantis* isn't really targeted at young children. There's no songs, there's very little comedy relief, the pacing is much slower, and there's hardly any action to speak of until the finale (which is quite good). Some concepts will also fly over the heads of little kids; even I didn't know what was going on one hundred percent of the time. Unfortunately for Disney, the older kids who might have benefitted from this more serious adventure story were getting their heads turned by Shrek and Lara Croft instead.

**In Conclusion**

*Atlantis* is an admirable effort by Disney to turn out a sci fi adventure film that plays things mostly straight, but it came along at the wrong cultural moment. As noted above, *Shrek* had seized the zeitgeist, and traditional animation was falling by the wayside anyway. Though it languished in relative obscurity for years and was generally viewed by all as a misfire, *Atlantis* has been enjoying some burgeoning reputation in recent times, which it deserves. It's not great, but it's good.

Will the SAG-AFTRA strike affect library content?,"So, I have a bad feeling about this.

"Your thoughts on ""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ey9krhanxcdb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1da9619ec94c851b11e1952d69ce99951400ef4b

**Overview**

*The Emperor's New Groove* was originally conceived as a more dramatic adventure set against a backdrop of Inca culture and mythology, to be called *Kingdom of the Sun*. Disney had noticed, however, that their funny movies had historically made more money than their more serious ones, and so ultimately switched gears and dialed up the comedy (and eliminated just about every reference to the real life Inca). Released shortly before *Shrek*, *The Emperor's New Groove* was a forebear of what would become a hot trend in children's animated movies during the 2000s; edgier, self-aware humor.

**Point by Point**

* *The Emperor's New Groove* has remarkably little to it. It's an enjoyable film, primarily because it parlays its comedy so well. The story is paper thin, and I found it difficult to care about the protagonists. Kuzco is patently unlikable for most of the film's running time, and Pacha is just kind of boring. (Pacha's kids are funny, though, especially when they're messing with Yzma.) Overall, I really do think the movie could have benefitted from some elaborate and lively musical numbers.
* The villainous Yzma and her dim-witted boy toy Kronk steal the show; the movie is definitely at its best when one or both of them are onscreen, and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton both give great performances. Kitt's performance as a maniacal kitten during the climax is particularly entertaining. (Of course, Kitt was famous for playing Catwoman on TV's *Batman*. I don't know if that's a deliberate nod, or just a coincidence.)

**In Conclusion**

Yeah, so, that's *The Emperor's New Groove*, I guess. I wish I had more to say about it. Good visuals, good voice acting, good comedy; not particularly memorable. It's pure fluff, but enjoyable fluff.

When will Disney release a middle east version of D+ on Windows ?,"Hello, I've been a subscriber to Disney+ since almost the first day it released in Egypt, since release there was no app for middle east viewers \*on windows\*, and there still isn't, is there any news/upcoming release date on when or if it there is going to be ?

why does it matter though ? for me at least

I only have a phone and a laptop, (besides the fact that my phone's screen is 720p), my laptop's screen is a beautiful 1080p OLED, and it frustrates me that i can't watch D+ content at 1080p on my laptop, i can only access it through the website, which for ""security reasons"" only goes up to 720p, the windows app doesn't work in the middle east region, it just says ""not available in your region"" when you open it

Funny enough the mobile version is different from say the US version, its a separate app for the middle east region, why can't they do this on desktop !

So for middle east viewers, not just myself, if i wanted to watch my content at 1080p id have to have a phone/tablet that supports this resolution or a smart TV so this isn't just my issue, I'm sure most people would like to watch D+ on their computers/laptops in FHD, is there any hope of a middle east windows version ?",4,0.75,5,agressive_wc_flusher,:Question: Question,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1689944086.0,False,False,False,2023-07-21 12:54:46,hello ive been a subscriber to disney since almost the first day it released in egypt since release there was no app for middle east viewers on windows and there still isnt is there any newsupcoming release date on when or if it there is going to be why does it matter though for me at least i only have a phone and a laptop besides the fact that my phones screen is p my laptops screen is a beautiful p oled and it frustrates me that i cant watch d content at p on my laptop i can only access it through the website which for security reasons only goes up to p the windows app doesnt work in the middle east region it just says not available in your region when you open it funny enough the mobile version is different from say the us version its a separate app for the middle east region why cant they do this on desktop so for middle east viewers not just myself if i wanted to watch my content at p id have to have a phonetablet that supports this resolution or a smart tv so this isnt just my issue im sure most people would like to watch d on their computerslaptops in fhd is there any hope of a middle east windows version,when will disney release a middle east version of d on windows,1

Bringing back older Disney shows,"I know by the title it may seem as if I'm asking for reboots, which I'm not ( even though that doesn't sound that bad), but I think there was something different in the older Disney shows. I mean nowadays there's barely anyone watching Disney ( at least the Disney series that are airing currently). Disney channel is recommended for ages 7-17, and do you know who's actually watching the shows? Eight year olds to ten year olds. But when the other Disney shows aired ( Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Lab Rats, Mighty Med, Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place) 7-17 year olds were actually watching Disney. If you're wondering about how I know this, I was a teenager in the mid 2000's. And now I nanny three kids. Those three kids would rather be watching shameless than Disney channel. Now this is where the problem comes in, kids in this generation shouldn't be watching adult shows, but Disney channel isn't fun for them anymore. To test out my theory that older Disney is better than newer Disney, I showed my kids the shows I used to watch. They are completely obsessed with Mighty Med and Hannah Montana now. When I was growing up you could watch Disney channel with your parents, mostly because of the jokes that flew over the kid's heads that the parents understood. But I've noticed how the dialogue and humour has now been dumbed down. When I have kids, I want them growing up with the Disney I had, not the new one. Before I end this post, i just want to share that in 2014 Disney had an average of two million daily viewers, and in 2022 they had just around 180 thousand.

Anyone think we'll get a bit of backstory to that one Skull masquerading as You-Know-Who for Secret Invasion's Finale?,"With the finale steadily approaching in under a week, the one thing I've been wondering the most is how they'll try to address that one Skrull that was revealed to not only be a female, but a female that has been masquerading as Rhodes throughout the series.

Ever since that reveal was hinted at a bit before being made official back on Episode 4, it ended up bringing up a lot of questions every time he came on screen. Like most importantly WHEN did she take up his identity and how long she's been masquerading as him. I'm willing to guess that it's been since Civil War at least because I remember back in Endgame when the group was asked about have any of them been to space before and he was one that hesitated slightly there. In hindsight that should've been something worth raising some eyebrows there a bit.

I'm also wondering if it'll end up answering where the real Rhodes is all this time too by the end of the finale, like whether he's in one of those chambers we've seen earlier in the series or if he's still in recovery after that fight between the Avengers back in Civil War. If it's revealed that he was dead all this time, it would be even more disheartening in itself. 

But with all that said... I'm certain that they would try to make sure that nothing bad would happen to the real Rhodes after this should he actually be brought back. They still have that Armor Wars movie, formerly a TV series, to come out with him in the lead role after all.

"Secret Invasion: a wasted opportunity, and an abandoned one at that...","#Intro
Hello, everyone!
Okay, so this will be a *generally* spoiler-free little ""take"", from a serious MCU nerd who also knows the source material. 

(By ""generally"" I mean that there is the assumption that you know the general plot synopsis, are aware of what skrulls are, their abilities, and their relationships with the other characters, etc. Stuff like that. So, with that in-mind, let's get into it...)

# ""A wasted opportunity""
So, the concept of a secret alien invasion where they can look like us is a brilliant one. It could be a great ""whodunit?"" where absolutely *anyone* could be an alien in disguise. Now, I know there is still one episode to go, but five episodes in, I'm *vastly* underwhelmed. It's had its moments of brilliance, of course. But there is absolutely no way in heckadoodle they are going to fulfill the premise's potential in *one* episode... Let me list some things I think are missing, here.

+ You cannot trust *anyone*. Even Nick Fury! As far as we know, there is no way to tell that a person is human (and not a skrull) except for injuring their flesh, which causes them to reveal themselves, just slightly, or if they die, when they transform completely. So why oh why oh why are our protagonists just casually meeting-up and doing *nothing* to confirm their identities?! They need to be cutting themselves even just a little bit, or heck, just a code phrase! There is *no caution whatsoever* when in this setup they need to be *overly* cautious! And there should *definitely* have been reveals that actually, that person isn't the protagonist after-all(!), to really lean-in to the mystery. 
+ The aliens could potentially disguise themselves *as other aliens* or at the very least as the other aliens' human disguises. *No one* has done this yet, five episodes in! Again, this would really up the stakes, increase the mystery, keep people guessing, etc.
+ Five episodes in, and we don't know why the antagonist is the way he is. He's angry at the humans - Fury in particular - but there's not even a little hint as to *why* . All we've got so far is that Fury hasn't found them a new home, like he promised at the end of Captain Marvel. He *could* be a really cool villain who we might even empaphise with, like the one from Black Panther. But instead, he's just bad... Because... Neither he nor Fury have even explained why/how the skrulls haven't managed to find somewhere on earth yet. There are *tonnes* of places they could go. There's only one million of them, for goodness sake...
+ In the comics, there was this whole thing where there were heroes and villains who were revealed to actually be skrulls! Because the skrulls could copy powers, not just faces and memories. So, we had heroes/villains who we *thought* were dead who actually weren't and heroes/villains who returned from the dead after it was revealed they had been taken by their dopplegangers, for instance. It was a great way for Marvel to ""retcon"" stuff they'd done in the past few years, and it really did keep people guessing! We've *kind-of* seen a little bit of this in the TV show when they revealed in episode 4 that someone we thought was a protagonist we know and love is actually a skrull in disguise, leaving us to wonder ""how long have they been a skrull? Have they *always* been a skrull?!"" but again, it's a really, really underused concept.
+ Too. Few. Episodes. Six episodes just isn't enough, simple as that! This *should* be an *epic* event spanning many, many more episodes, with tonnes more mysteries, fan theories, reveals, etc.
+ Why wasn't *this* ""phase four""? Let's be honest here, folks, I think most of us agree that phase 4 was a bit ""meh"", to-say-the-least. But Secret Invasion would have been *awesome*!!! We could have - *should* have - had the phase 4 movies have tiny little ""Easter eggs"", reveals, post-credits stuff etc leading-up to a big Avengers movie, ala The Infinity Saga. But nope, we get six episodes of TV, and a farely underwhelming ""phase"" instead :-( 

#Abandonment issues...
So, a *huge* number of MCU fans don't actually know this show even *exists* or are aware of it, but not that it's airing. Why? Little-to-no advertising!

For goodness sake, they don't even put Secret Invasion as the first thing on the ""Featured"" every week! And the thumbnail (little image) in the menus that you scroll through to pick what you want, it *doesn't even look like an MCU show* . It looks more like a spy show or something!

**Overview**

While Walt Disney Animation Studios had been supplementing their films with computer animation techniques for years, *Dinosaur* was the first of their films to use it entirely, in place of traditional animation. While the characters and creatures are animated, however, most of the backgrounds used in the movie are live-action, and were filmed on location. The blending of the two - the live-action backgrounds with realistic, 3D dinosaurs - makes for what is probably the most lifelike movie in the WDAS canon.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals really do look good. The opening sequence is a highlight, as we watch the orphaned Iguanodon egg make its epic journey far away from its destroyed nest and onto an island populated with prehistoric lemurs. The egg hatches there and the lemurs adopt the baby dinosaur into their family.
* The meteor shower that destroys the island is dramatic, and carries connotations of dread. After all, we know what wiped out the dinosaurs, right? As it turns out, this meteor shower isn't *the* meteor shower, but, upon my first viewing of *Dinosaur*, I did imagine that this might be the beginning of the end of the world.
* Aladar and the surviving lemurs end up joining a multi-species herd of herbivores on a trek across a vast, unforgiving wasteland to reach the idyllic nesting grounds. The herd's leader, Kron, is a cruel and callous master, cracking the whip constantly, and with no sympathy for the weak and infirm. He's presented as the heavy, of course, but it's hard to hold it against him. If we're talking about people, then yes, the strong absolutely should help the weak. But we all know that's not how dinosaurs managed to survive for millions of years. It's a long, hot, hazardous journey, with carnivores dogging their every step, and the herd simply can't slow down for the sake of the stragglers in the back.

**In Conclusion**

There isn't a whole lot to say about *Dinosaur*, really. While it looks great, its story and its characters are rather lackluster. Not much happens over the course of the movie, and nothing that does happen is particularly memorable. I wouldn't call it boring; I wasn't bored. It's just...it is what it is, I guess. *The Land Before Time* manages to be the more interesting and more emotional film about dinosaurs overcoming adversity to reach a lush valley.

Secret Invasion finale = Agents Of SHIELD return?,"I think that the Agents Of SHIELD will be officially returning to the MCU next week in the finale for Secret Invasion, and here is my evidence for my theory...

- Kevin Feige and others have confirmed that AOS *is still part of the MCU* (but has admittedly not confirmed they will be returning)
- The Marvel official website's biography of the MCU version of Nick Fury mentions AOS multiple times. It says nothing about the team and events in the show no longer being canon, or taking place in a different part of the multiverse. 
- AOS has been moved from the ""Marcel Legacies"" collection on Disney+, where all the non-canon stuff is (such as Inhumans, The Gifted or Legion) 
- When the first episode of Secret Invasion aired, the ""Featured""/""Showcase"" area of Disney+ had that show front-and-center... With AOS being the second thing on the list! Now why might that be, I wonder?.. 
- Chloe Bennet - aka ""Quake""/Daisy - did a social media video where she very passionately states that she is *not* going to be in Secret Invasion... Now, lots of characters have been speculated to be returning, lots of fans have been asking the actors if they are going to be in the show... But only *one* actor has adamantly denied it and issued a statement etc... In the past when actors have done this (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, for instance) it has been revealed they were very much lying, so could this be history repeating itself? ;-)

**Overview**

Walt Disney had originally conceived *Fantasia* as an ongoing project, which could be rereleased in perpetuity with new segments added to the mix each time. Obviously, this never panned out. In fact, *Fantasia* was a bit of a boondoggle, and didn't actually begin to make a profit until 1969, after several rereleases. The film enjoyed great commercial success upon its initial home video release in 1991, however, and sales convinced then CEO Michael Eisner that a follow-up could be viable. Thus, *Fantasia 2000* was born, following in the same model as its forebear.

**Point by Point**

* With little preamble, *Fantasia 2000* opens almost immediately onto an energetic and colorful sequence of geometric shapes behaving like butterflies and bats, set to part of Beethoven's 'Symphony No. Five'. It does a good job of setting the tone; whereas the original *Fantasia* opened with a more lilting and cerebral sequence set to Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D minor', this new iteration of *Fantasia* is faster paced and more bombastic.
* *Pines of Rome* shows us a bunch of humpback whales that can glide through the air as easily as they can underwater. It goes on a bit, but it's pretty, and it builds to an exciting finale full of thunder and lightning that sees the whales apparently bursting through the mythical firmament above the Earth and surfacing in outer space.
* *Rhapsody in Blue*, following the lives of four different characters in 1930s New York, is one of the more engaging segments, probably because of its strong, cohesive narrative. The segment immediately following, inspired loosely by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"", is good too. *The Carnival of the Animals* is brief, but fun.
* After a reiteration of *The Sorcerer's Apprentice*, Donald Duck gets his turn with *Pomp and Circumstance*. It's a pleasant bit of fluff, but nowhere near as epic or as legendary as Mickey's contribution.
* *Firebird Suite*, with its impressive visuals and its themes of destruction and rebirth, is a good one to go out on.

**In Conclusion**

There's no avoiding the fact that audiences had changed since the release of the original *Fantasia* in 1940. People back then were much more susceptible to awe and wonder when it came to animation. Entertainment and technology were both much simpler. Fast forward sixty years, however, and Disney wants to introduce the concept of *Fantasia* to generations of people who have grown up on TV, video games, rock n' roll, and Disney's own frenetic films like *Aladdin* and *The Lion King*. Though *Fantasia 2000* adheres to the model of its forebear, it was obvious to me during my viewing that the segments, in general, were faster, livelier, and far less abstract. (And the overall runtime is shorter by almost an hour.) All in all, I'd say Disney did an impressive job of retaining the heart and soul of *Fantasia* while tempering it to fit modern sensibilities.

As much as I respect *Fantasia* for what it is (and I really do respect it), you'll have noticed that I relegate it to the bottom tier in my personal ranking. The format just isn't my cup of tea; I'm not into it. I think I can just about justify placing *Fantasia 2000* in Tier B, however. Though I'm not much likelier to sit down and watch it again for fun, I do appreciate the aesthetic improvements Disney made to the format to make it more digestible.

"Your thoughts on ""Tarzan"" (1999)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Tarzan has been an iconic character for over a century now, but, unless you're old enough to remember the series of B movies starring Johnny Weissmuller, chances are Disney's *Tarzan* is the version you're most familiar with. And that's no bad thing. Dozens of Tarzan movies have been released over the decades, dating all the way back to the silent era, but I think Disney's *Tarzan* is likely the best of them all. With Walt Disney Animation Studios at the height of its creative powers, *Tarzan* manages to capture and convey the essence of the character and his world more ably than a nude bodybuilder on a 1930s soundstage could.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals and animation are gorgeous, and I think the medium of animation suits Tarzan extremely well. The way he surfs through the trees and swings from vines with both his hands and feet would be impossible to replicate in live-action. Likewise, his relationship with the gorillas is best depicted in typical Disney fashion (with the gorillas able to speak and emote). The music, too, is exemplary, with Phil Collins performing the songs as part of the narrative, rather than the characters singing themselves.
* The dramatic opening, with Collins singing 'Two Worlds', sets the tone right away for drama and excitement. Tarzan's shipwrecked parents arrive in the jungle and build their treehouse; Kerchak and Kala lose their baby to a leopard attack; Kala discovers the orphaned Tarzan and saves him from another leopard (or maybe the same one). It feels epic right off the bat.
* Young Tarzan has a hard time fitting in with the gorillas, but the 'Son of Man' (an invigorating and inspiring song) sequence shows him overcoming his weaknesses by embracing that which makes him different. Using his human ingenuity, he crafts tools like spears and lassos, and uses tricks to conquer his environment. This theme culminates with adult Tarzan's fight against the leopard. By saving Kerchak and slaying the leopard with the tip of a spear, he proves he's become a master of the jungle.
* Tarzan saving Jane from the angered baboons is a thrilling action sequence, followed immediately by his proper introduction to Jane and his meaningful realization that she's the same as he is. When young Tarzan compared his hands to Kala's hands earlier, he saw that they were similar, yet not alike. Now he touches his hand to Jane's, and he realizes, with awe, that creatures like him do exist.
* 'Strangers Like Me' is another great song set to a montage, this time of Tarzan learning about the human world. This and 'Son of Man' are both on my regular playlist.
* The scene where Kala shows Tarzan the treehouse where she found him is an emotional moment and handled well; essentially like a mother revealing to her child that he was adopted. Tarzan ultimately makes the choice to put on his father's old suit and go back to England with Jane.
* The climax - saving the gorillas from Clayton and his men - is exciting and action-packed, and Clayton gets the comeuppance he deserves. Tarzan and Kerchak finally have their moment, and Tarzan realizes he has to stay; not because he wouldn't be able to adjust to life in England, but because he must take his place as the new leader of the troop. Jane, of course, decides to stay with him. Two worlds, one family.

**In Conclusion**

The vaunted Disney Renaissance draws to a close with *Tarzan*, but what a film to go out on. With its visuals, music, and storytelling, I believe this just might be the definitive version of Tarzan, in the same way that so many other Disney adaptations have become the definitive versions of their own stories. A top-tier movie for sure.

"Your thoughts on ""Mulan"" (1998)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Prior to 1998, few people outside of China had ever heard the name Mulan. In true Disney fashion, however, the filmmakers took what might have once been an esoteric Far Eastern legend and turned it into a globally popular story that stands as a pillar of the Disney Renaissance.

**Point by Point**

* As is to be expected from a Disney animated movie of this era, the visuals look great. Even though it's a noticeably different aesthetic from *Beauty and the Beast* or *The Lion King* \- inspired by Chinese watercolor - *Mulan* still looks every bit as good as its contemporaries.
* Mulan is immediately likable, and follows well in the tradition of strong Disney heroines like Ariel, Belle, and Pocahontas. She's surrounded by an excellent supporting cast; her family and her friends in the army are well-rounded and sympathetic, and Mushu provides sharp, observational comic relief. Even the mute Cricket serves a purpose by giving Mushu someone to riff to and play off of.
* Shan Yu, the Hun leader, is a dark, intimidating villain, but, as far as Disney antagonists go, he's one of the weakest. He's not really fleshed out at all, and, beyond being the guy who wants to kill the Emperor for some arbitrary reason, he isn't given much of a personality. To this day most people can't even recall the character's name. (I had to look it up.) But that's okay, because Shan Yu doesn't present the story's true obstacle. The real conflict of *Mulan* is the heroine's journey of self-discovery and determination, and her triumph in the face of adversity. That's the main point of all this here. Shan Yu presents merely a sinister monolith to be overcome once Mulan has come into herself.
* 'Reflection' is a good character song, giving us insight into Mulan's inner turmoil. The scene soon afterwards, where Mulan's father is given his conscription orders, is a dramatic one. He and the rest of the family all know it's his death warrant, and Mulan is keenly aware that things would be different if her parents had had a son instead. The sequence in which Mulan cuts her hair, takes her father's armor, and rides off into the night is done exceedingly well.
* 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' is a great song for a training montage. Notably, Mulan is given a way out here. After continuous failure, Captain Shang tells her to pack up and go home; but she doesn't. Instead she climbs up the pole and gets that arrow. As she admits later on, she's doing this for her father, but not *just* for her father.
* 'A Girl Worth Fighting For' is a cheery, upbeat number to cover the time spent marching, though it ends abruptly mid-sentence when the troops come upon the burned village and the remains of the Imperial Army. The subsequent battle on the mountain pass, culminating with the avalanche that wipes out most of the Huns, is one of the most impressive and exciting set pieces in any Disney animated film, and the climax in the Imperial City is nearly as good.

**In Conclusion**

A dramatic, exciting, and relatable story from beginning to end, with likable characters and good music. Definitely top-tier stuff.

"Your thoughts on ""Hercules"" (1997)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

*Hercules* came along at exactly the right time for me. I had just finished sixth grade, and we had covered a whole unit on Greek mythology that year, so I was into it. As might be expected, Disney's take on the legend is unique in a way that might displease purists and anthropologists, but it's still a fun movie (and, beat for beat, it's remarkably similar to 1978's *Superman*).

**Point by Point**

* Olympus and the Underworld both look amazing; probably the two best settings in the movie. Disney had to soften both Zeus and Hera considerably in order to make them likable. Hera in particular is...*pink*. Just...really, really *pink*. For that matter, the Hades of Greek myth was largely inoffensive. He tended to just stay in the Underworld and mind his own business. (Zeus, ironically, was much worse.) Disney's Hades, on the other hand, is more in line with the common cultural perception of Satan; a fire-based prince of darkness who deals in souls. James Woods does a masterful job of bringing some snark and some sleaze to the character.
* Hercules as the earnest, wide-eyed dope and Megara as the cynical woman who's been burned before creates a good dynamic that's deliberately reminiscent of the relationships between the leads of many a film from the ""screwball comedy"" genre of the 1930s. It's a good way to mix things up, especially since Megara starts out allied with Hades. Her song 'I Won't Say (I'm in Love)' is perfect for her.
* The movie starts out a bit slow. I'd say the first really good scene is Hercules' rescue of Megara from the centaur. His battle against the computer animated Hydra soon after looks fantastic. The best part of the movie comes in the third act, with Hades' war on Olympus and Hercules' rescue of Megara's soul from the Underworld.

**In Conclusion**

For a Disney Renaissance movie, *Hercules* is a bit toothless; a bit insubstantial. After the more dramatic *Pocahontas* and *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, I think it relies too much on jokes and gags. It has its moments, and I like Megara, but the story is mostly fluff, and none of the songs are stand-outs.

"Your thoughts on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1996)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/24byvnb1wvab1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=771e72abd5cd888d3289ab923ecd23d99f74e9b9

**Overview**

How did Disney ever manage to make a children's movie out of *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*? Well, the answer is, they changed virtually everything about the story and the characters. Even having done that, however, they still came out with the darkest, moodiest, most dramatic movie in the WDAS canon. *Hunchback* is short on comedy and whimsy, and long on themes of lust, damnation, and genocide, and some of it is bound to sail over the heads of most children. Despite its almost complete departure from its source novel, it's a great movie with a great story.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals and music are striking and impressive right away, from the first shot of Notre Dame cathedral peeking through the clouds, and the first chords of the epic opening song 'The Bells of Notre Dame'. Quasimodo's backstory really sets the tone for the rest of the movie; within the first five minutes we see Frollo murder a woman and attempt to drown her baby in a well. (It ain't *The Aristocats*, that's for sure.)
* As the song says, Frollo ""saw corruption everywhere, except within."" He's a hypocrite of the highest order; as pious as he is hateful; the kind of man who has read the Bible from cover to cover without truly comprehending a word of it. He's a liar, a sadist, and a murderer, and he *revels* in it. Yet, when it comes to the matter of sin, he looks only outward at everyone around him. At least villains like Maleficent, Ursula, and Jafar are true to themselves and their ideologies, but Frollo is torturing and murdering people while holding himself to be an arbiter of justice and godliness. Sadly, there have always been people like that in this world.
* Quasimodo is characterized well. In the novel he's deaf, and kind of a simpleton, but Disney retools him here to make him a more functional, more relatable protagonist (and also more central to the narrative). The way he swings and leaps agilely around the outside of the cathedral, across the towers, gutters, and parapets, is very well conceived and animated. In this way, he's not a prisoner; the entire cathedral is his playground.
* *Hunchback* is extremely light on humor, with the trio of gargoyles providing the only substantial comedy relief. I think their presence is necessary, if only so Quasimodo can have someone to talk to. Years of isolation and Frollo's emotional abuse have really taken their toll, and having Quasimodo just completely alone would be way too gloomy.
* The Festival of Fools is a fun, colorful sequence (where Esmeralda performs as sexually charged a dance as Disney could likely get away with); that is, until the crowd turns on Quasimodo and begins to humiliate and abuse him in a scene that's genuinely difficult to watch.
* 'God Help the Outcasts' is a beautiful song, and the lavish interior shots of the cathedral are breathtaking. In fact, everything in this movie looks spectacular. It just might be the best-looking Disney animated film done in the traditional style.
* Phoebus is the handsome jock to Quasimodo's shy nerd; he's the traditional hero type with whom Esmeralda falls in love. Given this, it would have been easy for Disney to portray him as an arrogant jerk who ultimately turns out to be a villain (especially since this is kind of how he is in the novel), clearing the way for Quasimodo to emerge as the rightful heir to Esmeralda's affections. But Phoebus is actually a good guy. As much as Quasimodo deserves love, I think it speaks well of the filmmakers that they didn't contrive to couple him up with the female lead in the end.
* 'Hellfire', of course, is a highlight of the film, and one of the best songs in the WDAS canon. It's powerful, intense, and woven perfectly into the narrative. And it's not even a song for the kids, because it's all about Frollo's panic over his lust for a woman and his frenzy to root it out.
* The movie only picks up from here, with Frollo's mad crusade to find Esmeralda eventually consuming all of Paris. The sequence at the Court of Miracles, and then the climactic siege of Notre Dame after Quasimodo's dramatic, visually stunning rescue of Esmeralda from the pyre. It's all a fantastic set piece that ends up extremely satisfying, to a soaring reprise of 'The Bells of Notre Dame'.

**In Conclusion**

One of the best Disney movies yet, if not *the* best. Gorgeous visuals and music, great characters, and deeper than usual themes all combine to deliver us a uniquely excellent film. Disney had never made something like this before, and probably never will again.

**Tier Ranking**

By the way, now that I've gotten through thirty-four Disney movies, I think I've gained enough of a frame of reference to begin ranking these by tier, which will be easier and ultimately more meaningful than ranking by number. (Within the tiers, they're listed in order of release.)

Subtitles Inclusivity,"Walt Disney Studios is one of the top five major film studios and controls more money than I can imagine, yet Disney+ has such a limited range of subtitle languages, some shows even lack them entirely. For a studio with such a global reach this seems ridiculous? 

  
The range of dubbed languages is much larger, but will not include all the languages of Disney's audience- it's so much quicker and cheaper to just add subtitles so could cover an even larger range of languages and would be accessible to those with hearing loss.   
I am learning French, and have had no luck finding any French subtitles on Disney+. In desperation I went to Miraculous Ladybug, an actual French show, that still had no French subtitles (although this might be a blessing in disguise for my sanity)

  
I understand that the service has launched relatively recently in comparison to some others, but this still seems unacceptable, especially with recent advances in auto-translate technologies. It may be an issue specifically with my region, but there are obviously still people in my region who speak languages other than English.

"Your thoughts on ""Pocahontas"" (1995)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

*Pocahontas* isn't historically accurate, let's get that out of the way right now. It's not an account of something that really happened. It's a fairy tale, starring fictional characters who just happen to be named after people who lived four hundred years ago. But that can be said of a lot of great movies purported to be based on historical people and events; movies like *Braveheart*, *Gladiator*, and *The Sound of Music*. So, let's not judge *Pocahontas* too harshly on that score; it still accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is tell a good story, sing a few songs, and teach the kiddies a lesson about tolerance.

**Point by Point**

* The movie opens with John Smith, Governor Ratcliffe, and the other settlers boarding their ship to leave England, then dealing with a squall at sea, during which Smith saves a young sailor named Thomas from drowning. After that bit of excitement, we transition to the Native Americans singing and harvesting. It seems peaceful and idyllic, but Chief Powhatan and the other men have just returned from a war with a rival nation. It's an acknowledgement that violence and conflict existed in the New World long before the white man showed up.
* The visuals and scenery are beautiful; definitely the best-looking forest landscapes since *Bambi*.
* Pocahontas is beautiful, graceful, and free-spirited. The first thing we see her do is dive off a high cliff into the water below. She's well animated, and the way she moves is unique. She's not just Belle in a buckskin. When she runs she takes huge strides and pounds the earth with her feet, arms pumping at her sides. And when she's spying on John Smith, she creeps along the ground and over rocks like someone accustomed to moving stealthily through the forest.
* I'd say that *Pocahontas* is easily the most serious Disney animated film yet (though it is surpassed in this by its immediate successor, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*). There's a lot of drama and talking, and not very much comedy, although Meeko, Flit, and Percy provide some occasional slapstick. Personally, as an adult viewer, I'm fine with that. During this marathon through the movies, I'm finding I have a greater appreciation for the drama and less of a desire to see it interrupted by excessive comedy.
* The initial meeting between Pocahontas and John Smith, and the first skirmish between the settlers and the Indians, are both good sequences, as is the colorful, invigorating montage set to 'Colors of the Wind'. 'Mine, Mine, Mine' is a rousing number as well.
* Judging by the conversation Ratcliffe has with his servant, Wiggins, he's not exactly in favor with King James at this time. He's greedy, for sure, but he's not looking for gold just so he can buy nice things; he needs that gold in order to buy back his reputation at court. That's why he's so desperately ready to believe that the Indians are hiding the gold from him; because the only alternative is that there is no gold, and if there's no gold, he's finished.
* Tensions have been building between the two camps, and they come to a head when Thomas ends up shooting the warrior (and Pocahontas' potential suitor) Kocoum in defense of John Smith. The climactic song 'Savages' really drives home the hatred that each side feels for the other, with both the settlers and the Indians regarding each other as ""barely even human"". It's not subtle, but, hey, it's a kids' movie.
* The moment when Pocahontas stops a war by saving John Smith from her father's wrath is a good one, and, just in case you thought the drama was over, Smith ends up taking a bullet for Powhatan immediately afterwards. Smith has to be taken back to England to heal (and Ratcliffe has to be taken back to face justice), but Pocahontas chooses to stay at home. Notably, *Pocahontas* is the first instance in the WDAS canon of the primary romance splitting up at the end. The two leads do not live happily ever after together. Kudos to Disney for not sticking Pocahontas on that ship.

**In Conclusion**

It may not be peak Disney, but *Pocahontas* is a good, low-key adventure with drama, romance, some good songs, a constructive social lesson, and visuals that, in their own way, look as good as those in *The Lion King*. I enjoyed it.

**Overview**

What is there to say about *The Lion King* that hasn't already been said? It's peak Disney, and very few films in the WDAS canon have achieved its prestige and legacy. It was the highest grossing film of its release year, it has become a multimedia franchise unto itself, and it is still regarded today as one of the best animated films ever.

**Point by Point**

* The opening hits hard and fast, with that burning sun and the soaring opening chords of 'Circle of Life'. That's literally the first thing your senses get as the movie begins. No ""Walt Disney Presents"". No storybook opening. Just ""BAAAAAAAAAA BAKWANZAAAAAAA!!!"" (And yes, I know those aren't the lyrics, but I don't speak Zulu, so that's what I'm hearing.) *The Lion King* really is the best-looking Disney animated feature so far, and this opening sequence exemplifies that with its colors, lighting, and animation. The animals, too, look better than ever. Baby Simba's presentation ceremony is invigorating, and really sets the tone.
* Scar, of course, is a great villain; clever, conniving, intimidating, and, at his core, extremely petty. He longs to be king, but only because he believes, myopically, that it will make him happy and fulfilled; only because he wants to be ""respected, saluted, and seen for the wonder I am"". He has no interest in actually being in charge; in being responsible for the well-being of the pride. When he does finally achieve his ambition, he just sits around while everything goes to hell. He's king, and he does nothing with it. As Mufasa points out to Simba, ""There's more to being king than getting your way all the time.""
* Most Disney animated films have one or two signature songs that really stand out and become inextricably linked with the film's identity. *Dumbo* has 'When I See an Elephant Fly'; *The Little Mermaid* has 'Part of Your World' and 'Under the Sea'; *Frozen* has 'Let It Go'. In *The Lion King*'s case, however, I think all of the songs loom equally large in our cultural consciousness, whether it's the fun, colorful, and raucous 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King', the moody villain song 'Be Prepared', the joyful and catchy 'Hakuna Matata', or the romantic ballad 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight'. Any of these songs (along with, of course, the aforementioned 'Circle of Life') is liable to pop into your head when you think of *The Lion King*.
* Likewise, it's amazing how Disney's visuals and animation have taken yet another quantum leap forward. We've just had *Beauty and the Beast* and *Aladdin*, yet *The Lion King* manages to look even better. The animals themselves are designed exquisitely, and every setting - from the sprawling, sun-baked Savannah, to the eerie elephant graveyard, to Timon and Pumbaa's idyllic oasis - is breathtaking. The stampede is an incredible set piece, immersive and overwhelming.
* I knew that *The Lion King* took some light inspiration from *Hamlet*, but, in doing my due diligence for this entry in the Disney canon, I learned that the Biblical story of Moses was also considered. I didn't see much similarity at first, apart from Moses exiling himself in the wilderness for years, but, under closer scrutiny, Rafiki's appearance to Simba and his exhortation to him to return could be a parallel to Moses' ""burning bush"" moment.
* The third act is full of good moments, whether it's the dramatic appearance of Mufasa's admonishing spirit, or the abrupt and absurd hula number performed by Timon and Pumbaa amidst the incongruous menace and gloom. The final clash between Simba and Scar is properly epic, and Scar's comeuppance is extremely satisfying. A cleansing rain follows, Simba assumes the throne, and, as we see in the film's final frames, the circle of life continues.

**In Conclusion**

With tremendous visuals and music, a great story, and top-notch performances by an all-star cast, *The Lion King* takes the throne. I did wrestle a bit, as I feel like I enjoyed *Beauty and the Beast* and *The Little Mermaid* just a bit more (I seem to be partial to the princess movies for some reason), but I just can't justify ranking *The Lion King* lower, so, to the top it goes. Eventually, when all's said and done, I'm going to have to break this list into tiers for a more accurate picture of my ranking.

Methods to get the best ultrawide viewing experience,"EDIT UP TOP: The Ultrawidify extension started working a day later (after a restart I suppose) and now I can view full screen on Microsoft Edge and the quality is pretty good.  


  
Hi all, lovely community!As others have posted, I'm trying to watch Disney + on my Ultrawide 4k monitor. The black bars are such a waste of *space* when watching shows like Mando and the newest Secret Invasion.

I've gotten some luck with the **Disney Plus Ultrawide Fullscreen Support** extension for Chrome, but Chrome's quality is lacking in streaming picture quality.

I've got an M1 Mac and a Dell PC and tried all different browsers and the official Disney + Windows app, but nothing else seems to work. Ultrawidify, another extension that has been recommended, didn't work on either machine.

Am I stuck with Chrome and bad picture quality but full-widescreen viewing with the extension, or does someone else have a suggestion I could try?

Thanks in advance!

**Overview**

Over the decades Disney had delivered us several fairy tales set in medieval Europe, a few in Victorian England, and even one or two in the urban United States, but *Aladdin* marked the first story set in exotic and unfamiliar Arabia. A favorite of the Disney Renaissance, *Aladdin* is a dazzling and adventurous tale, distinguished by its greater than usual emphasis on comedy, thanks largely to the performance by the late, great Robin Williams, who was allowed to improvise much of his dialogue.

**Point by Point**

* The opening is sweeping and majestic, set to the bombastic tune of 'Arabian Nights', and establishes the setting right away as one with which we're less familiar. The visuals, in general, are exquisitely colorful, and both characters and backgrounds look as if they could have been lifted from a storybook. The Cave of Wonders - both outside and inside - and the ""ends of the Earth"", with its driving blizzard, are both particular stand-outs.
* Like *Beauty and the Beast*'s 'Belle', the opening song 'One Jump Ahead' is an excellent character anthem that makes us immediately familiar with the main protagonist, his world, and his plight. After getting to know Aladdin as we watch him go to great lengths to escape the palace guards with a stolen loaf of bread, we see him hesitate only a moment before handing his hard-won bread over to a pair of starving orphan children. Moments later, he throws himself into harm's way to protect those same children from the cruel whip of a visiting prince. Abu is a good sidekick, providing mischief and comic relief.
* Jafar is an excellent villain; dark, slimy, conniving, and mostly competent. Maleficent and Ursula are still my favorites, but I'm not talking down Jafar. He's definitely one of Disney's strongest antagonists.
* The Genie, of course, grabs the movie with both hands and runs away with it the first moment he appears. He definitely pulls focus throughout the rest of the show, but his magical nature and the spirit of Robin Williams make him a natural star. He allows for a lot of comedy and spectacle, both of which inform the terrific songs 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali'.
* 'A Whole New World' is the midway showstopper we've come to expect from this era of Disney movies. Not only is it a great song (it won an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Golden Globe), but the visuals of the Magic Carpet ride through the night and across multiple countries are gorgeous.
* Jafar seizing control of the Genie and banishing Aladdin might present the most daunting ""all is lost"" moment we've seen yet in a Disney animated movie. That's what makes Aladdin's storming of the palace and his confrontation with Jafar so exciting, and Jafar's comeuppance so satisfying. (I like that Jafar's ideal look for the captive Jasmine is basically Peggy Bundy from *Married...With Children*. You know, with the trashy clothes and the big hair. I guess that's just what gets Jafar's engine running.)
* It seems like it was a little too easy for the Sultan to change the law about Jasmine needing to marry a prince. He can just do that, unilaterally and arbitrarily? And if he could have done that all along, then *why didn't he?*

**In Conclusion**

With its excellent visuals and music and fun story, *Aladdin* is definitely a masterpiece, there's no doubt about that. Having said that, however, I didn't connect with the characters and their struggles quite as effectively as I did with those in my favorites, nor was I as awed by it as I was those other films. And I'm sure I'm asking for trouble here, but I found Robin Williams' routines to be a little bit much at times. (Like the merchant bit at the beginning was a bit cringe. And what was the point of the Jack Nicholson impression?) I know this is going to be unpopular, but, while it still gets a position of honor, I can't place it right at the top.

"Your thoughts on ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Okay, after a brief diversion with *The Rescuers Down Under*, we're back in the bloom of the Disney Renaissance; back on Broadway! Disney puts their own, unique spin on another beloved fairy tale, and boy, does it pay off. Utilizing new animation technology and new methods for their songwriting, Walt Disney Animation Studios gave us what is still considered to this day to be one of their best films. It was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture the following year. No disrespect to *The Silence of the Lambs*, but *Beauty and the Beast* deserved that award.

**Point by Point**

* *Beauty and the Beast* is exquisite from the outset. The stained glass windows are an excellent way of summing up the Beast's backstory, and a creative departure from the traditional storybook intro. The lavish artistry on display here really sets the tone for the masterpiece that's to come.
* The visuals and animation are better than in any Disney movie seen so far, surpassing even *The Little Mermaid*. The music, too, is tremendous. The opening number, 'Belle', is a great character song, effectively introducing us to the heroine. And, in the same song, we meet Gaston, who serves as an excellent subversion of the Prince Charming trope. Under normal circumstances he'd be the hero of the story, but he's not just handsome and strong; he's also arrogant, selfish, and cruel.
* Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts (as well as the rest of the castle servants) are good additions to the cast. You can't have just the Beast, after all; too lonely and dour. Lumiere and Cogsworth, in particular, share an effective dynamic.
* Upon our first proper look at the Beast, when he's menacing Maurice, he's quite fearsome and intimidating; hulking and savage. And he's not misunderstood or maligned, either. At this point in the story, the Beast is awful; he's petty, vindictive, and uncaring. Remember the act of callousness that got him into this mess in the first place? Well, he just repeated it with Maurice, denying the old man shelter for the night. Over the long years cooped up in his castle he's learned nothing.
* The lavish musical numbers of *Beauty and the Beast* really do drive home how far we've come since 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat'. The song 'Gaston' is a rousing crowd-pleaser, and 'Be Our Guest' is probably the most spectacular number in a Disney movie up to this point.
* Belle's panicked flight from the castle, out into the snow, and the Beast rescuing her from a pack of wolves is an exciting sequence. And, somehow, her leaving later to find her father (with the Beast's blessing) is just as dramatic.
* The ballroom scene; the visuals, the animation, and Angela Lansbury's stirring rendition of the title song. (Reportedly, she performed it perfectly on her first try, and everyone in the studio was weeping.) *Nothing* that Disney had done up to this point is better than this.
* 'The Mob Song' is the perfect number to suit the ever more villainous Gaston, and leads directly into one of the best action climaxes yet, particularly the rooftop duel between Gaston and the Beast. And the transformation of the Beast, the servants, and the castle itself is breathtaking.

**In Conclusion**

I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. *Beauty and the Beast* is the best WDAS movie so far, and one of the best in general. What more is there to say?

"Your thoughts on ""The Rescuers Down Under"" (1990)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vg6mkgf0vw8b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d130a4f81db9f9e0761617dce0c641466db6684

**Overview**

Circa the mid-1980s, *The Rescuers* had become one of Disney's most successful animated films. Thus it became the first WDAS movie to receive a sequel. With no songs, and with a greater emphasis on action, *The Rescuers Down Under* attempts to be more of an adventure movie. It pleased critics, but underperformed at the box office, thanks in large part to sharing its release date with the smash hit *Home Alone*.

**Point by Point**

* Whereas Bernard and Bianca were rarely offscreen in the original *The Rescuers*, this film focuses a good deal on just the child, Cody. In the first few minutes we see him free soloing a huge, sheer cliff, like Ethan Hunt at the start of *Mission: Impossible 2*, then soaring high above the clouds on the back of Marahute, the great golden eagle. (Obviously not the same animal as the real-life [golden eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle), which is considerably smaller, not endangered, and not found in Australia.)
* McLeach is a decent villain; not one of the all-time greats, but well-suited to this particular story. He's slimy, bad-tempered, and intimidating. I feel bad for his pet lizard, Joanna. McLeach is repeatedly abusive to her, always kicking her in the stomach or threatening to shoot her. It drives home how heartless and cruel he is.
* The difference in art styles between this movie and its predecessor are apparent right away. *The Rescuers* looks like a 1970s Disney movie, and *The Rescuers Down Under* looks like a 1990s Disney movie. It's got some good-looking scenes, including the mouse restaurant on top of the chandelier, and practically every moment that takes place in the Outback.
* John Candy's Wilbur is a good substitute for Orville (whose voice actor, Jim Jordan, had passed away). Speaking of Wilbur, does anyone else think his scenes at the mouse clinic seem a little...out of place? The mouse doctor is crazy and sadistic, and he and his nurses torture Wilbur, and menace him with a chainsaw. And we're supposed to...laugh, I guess? I dunno, it just strikes me as cruel and unpleasant, and it doesn't do anything to benefit the story.
* The scene with Cody locked up with McLeach's captured animals seems like it's just there to kill time. It doesn't serve the plot in any way. You could cut it out completely and the movie would remain unaffected. The climax at Crocodile Falls, where McLeach attempts to feed Cody to the crocs, is sufficiently exciting and moody, and McLeach gets a satisfying comeuppance.

**In Conclusion**

More of a brief diversion from the Disney Renaissance than an actual part of it, *The Rescuers Down Under* is honestly rather bland, and feels lacking in the same spirit and heart that made the original a standout of a mediocre era.

"Your thoughts on ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

The start of the Disney Renaissance! *The Little Mermaid* has more effort and more budget put into it than any WDAS movie in decades, and it shows. Not only has the animation and storytelling taken a quantum leap forward, but I think this is the first WDAS movie that could really, properly be described as a musical. The songs in prior Disney features are mostly incidental, or are meant to provide atmosphere, but *The Little Mermaid* is like a Broadway show; its songs are very much woven into the DNA of the narrative. This new formula and new devotion to the art form would pave the way for a prestigious run of films throughout the 1990s, the likes of which Disney had not seen before and has not seen since.

**Point by Point**

* Right away, the underwater environments and the colorful flora and fauna are impressive. Ariel is cute, feisty, and instantly likable. Her fiery red hair is iconic, but I think her most striking feature is her huge, expressive eyes (yes, her eyes). Like Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora before her, she wins the viewer's sympathy and love almost immediately. Flounder, Sebastian, and Scuttle all make good sidekicks.
* Ursula is easily the darkest, most intimidating villain since Cruella de Vil. With the slimy insidiousness of an octopus and the exaggerated manner of a drag performer, her presence is domineering and her personality unforgettable. I think she and Maleficent are my favorite Disney villains.
* The scene in Ariel's grotto full of human artifacts, where she sings 'Part of Your World', really demonstrates the quality of *The Little Mermaid*. The animation, the lighting, Ariel's expressiveness, and Jodi Benson's tremendous singing voice all contribute. This leads straight into Ariel's rescue of Prince Eric from the violent storm, which is one of the most dramatically exciting sequences we've seen in a Disney movie in some time, and that shot of her singing on the rock while she watches Eric on the beach and the surf crashes behind her is exquisite.
* The songs in this movie really soar. As I noted above, the Broadway influence really makes a difference. Prior Disney movies had numbers performed by choruses or jazz musicians, but *The Little Mermaid* is giving its all with material that Andrew Lloyd Webber would be proud of. The insanely bouncy and colorful 'Under the Sea' is a proper showstopper.
* After Triton's dramatic destruction of Ariel's collection, Ursula's two eels slither on in, like the serpent in Eden, and put a flea in Ariel's ear about seeking help from the sea witch. Ursula dwells inside the carcass of some long-dead behemoth, guarded by a menagerie of wretched creatures that used to be mermaids and mermen and were foolish enough to strike a bargain with her. We know that Triton exiled her from the palace some indeterminate amount of time prior, but we don't know why. Her song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' is a great villain anthem that starts out velvety and coaxing, then grows more boisterous and more insistent until Ursula is practically shouting at Ariel to accept her Faustian bargain. The tension climaxes with Ursula's occult chanting, and then Ariel's tail splitting into a pair of human legs as Flounder and Sebastian rush her to the surface.
* Ariel trying to adjust to surface life - combing her hair with a fork, etc. - is good for comedy, as is the sequence in the kitchen with Sebastian and Chef Louis.
* 'Kiss the Girl' is another great musical sequence; catchy, magical, with sparkling, moonlit scenery.
* The climax is spectacular and exciting, starting with Ariel crashing Eric and Ursula's wedding, getting her voice back, and freeing Eric of Ursula's enchantment. But the sun sets and Ariel changes back into a mermaid. Ursula grabs her and takes her back down into the sea, where she's intercepted by Triton. Seeing no other alternative, Triton consents to take Ariel's place in Ursula's ""garden"", and Ursula seizes his crown and trident. She grows immense, and uses her new power to summon a hurricane and raise wrecks from the deep. Fortunately, Eric is able to use one of these wrecks to impale her, and she dies in dramatic fashion.
* The finale is extremely satisfying, with Triton using his power to turn Ariel back into a human and blessing her marriage to Eric. All's well that ends well.

**In Conclusion**

Not only is *The Little Mermaid* the best Disney animated movie since *Sleeping Beauty*, but I think it actually surpasses it. It took three decades of lesser entries, but Walt Disney's 1959 masterpiece is finally toppled from its high throne.

Isn't it False Advertising to have pull content on the ondisneyplus Disney website?,"There are posts for Stargirl and Hollywood Stargirl on the ondisneyplus Disney website even though they have both been recently removed from platform.

My take of a Disney musical comedy episodic animated series aimed for the current younger demographic,"Well, now that Disney television animation will focus primarily on episodic musical comedy shows aimed for younger audience that will air on Disney + and Disney channel (Disney XD also but will soon be dead) while serialized ones which are aimed for older audience and mostly produced by Disney Europe Animation will air on Disney+ only.

I thought I will explain my pitch for a musical comedy episodic animated series that Disney can use and aim for young audience and well let’s just say it kinda rips off from the animated series from Canada called Grojband, so anyway here is my pitch

My take of a musical comedy episodic animated series will focus on some indie teen rock band who must come up with some songs and perform in front of a crowd and make it big while going on some crazy adventures, near the end of the episode, the band will perform the song inspired from their adventures and problems of the week and the B-plot involves their younger siblings who are also going on some crazy adventures like their elder siblings but different.

What inspired me to create this pitch? Well, seeing that the current trend of musical comedy episodic animated series made by Disney began with Phineas and Ferb that started with one of their iconic episodes Flop Starz attract viewers especially that Disney always make musicals a long time ago from the very beginning starting with Snow white and the seven dwarfs (1937) , I think I can deal with that era as the animated series will move on from the serialized era even though it will move on to Disney+ and be aimed for older audience.

But as the musical comedy episodic animated series focus on comedy in wacky situations, it couldn’t focus on the main thing and that’s music itself along with the musicians, so I thought this pitch of musical comedy episodic animated series if turned real if Disney accepts would focus on a Garage Rock Band performing songs and make a song based on their adventures like how Big time rush and Grojband did.

Fixing the Pillarbox Effect for Shows on Disney+,"I've noticed that a lot of old TV shows on Disney+ in 4:3 aspect ratio (Doogie Howser, Ally McBeal, Family Guy, etc.) will be ""pillarboxed"" to 16:9. Essentially, black bars will be added to the right and left sides of the source video to force it into a 16:9 aspect ratio.

However, since these boxes are added to the *source* of the video, and not the *displayed* video, when you try watching one of these shows on a 4:3 monitor, it looks like a postage stamp.

[\\""postage stamp\\"" effect \(black bars all around the actual picture\)](https://preview.redd.it/thmmbbr2d78b1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=f412561af7e843e1abdf350a6a5e204e15d7c8cd)

This is a combination of the pillarbox forcing a 4:3 video into a 16:9 aspect ratio, and then being displayed on a 4:3 monitor. If Disney+ didn't force pillarboxing on these shows, this problem wouldn't exist.

For example, a lot of Disney Channel originals (Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, etc) are uploaded in their native 4:3 aspect ratio, and look fine on these displays.

As a big fan of retro TV, I love watching these old shows on 4:3 monitors, but getting ""postage stamped"" by Disney+ ruins it. It drove me so nuts that I built a Google Chrome extension to fix this problem.

Once the extension is enabled, it will remove the pillarboxing for old shows and display them correctly:

[postage stamp effect removed with the extension](https://preview.redd.it/87bl4ewpe78b1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2105f9f02624051e696ee9f3ec52f9fe431be96)

**It only does this on 4:3 monitors**, so if you're watching on a normal 16:9 monitor, your shows won't be affected. It also **won't apply this effect to shows that are already natively in 4:3**, like the Disney Channel original TV shows. However, if you're watching a show that's in 16:9, it'll scale it so that you don't get a letterbox effect on your 4:3 monitor (you can easily disable this effect through the plugin options menu).

I understand that this is an incredibly niche problem to have and solve, but I figured at least one other person would have this issue. The plugin is entirely [open source](https://github.com/nicholasc120/Disney-PillarUnboxing) and link to download is [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disney%2B-pillar-unboxing/fbclpdcoipildpbipaoddfoaijleaemm).

"Your thoughts on ""Oliver & Company"" (1988)"," 

https://preview.redd.it/8h3dbkxir78b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4fbb029926188f80176441c0e1791f0144ee4ea

**Overview**

Disney's loose interpretation of *Oliver Twist*, in which Oliver is a kitten, the street thieves are dogs, and Fagin is voiced by Dom DeLuise. The 1980s appeared to mark a time of uncertainty for Walt Disney Animation Studios. After the catastrophic failure of *The Black Cauldron*, and with stiff competition from Don Bluth, it seems to me that WDAS might have been struggling with their identity. Indeed, *Oliver & Company*, with its contemporary setting, its pop rock soundtrack, and its loan shark villain, is a marked departure from their usual fairy tale fare.

**Point by Point**

* The opening song 'Once Upon a Time in New York City' (performed by Huey Lewis) really serves to set the tone, helping to establish New York as this bittersweet, even ethereal place where dreams can come true, even as poor Oliver is dodging cars and stray dogs and being swept through the gutter by the torrential rain. The city presents a grittier, more urban backdrop than we're used to, complete with real brand names (Coca-Cola, Kodak, Ryder) on the signboards.
* Oliver is cute and likable, and his tenacity and determination are endearing. Even after a hellish night by himself on the street, and even as Dodger leads him on a daunting and perilous chase through Manhattan, he doesn't give up his rights to half of those hot dogs, and he tails Dodger all the way to Fagin's barge. Dodger's song 'Why Should I Worry?' (performed by Billy Joel, who also provides Dodger's speaking voice) is pretty catchy.
* Sykes is a suitably menacing villain; a loan shark/gangster who speaks with a throat full of gravel and is often enshrouded in shadows and cigar smoke. You really do believe that he might kill Fagin at any moment. His two Dobermans play the role of henchmen. Unlike the henchmen of so many other Disney villains, they are *not* there to provide comic relief.
* Fagin's dogs provide the usual cast of colorful characters. There's Tito the hot-headed Chihuahua, Francis the snobbish bulldog, Einstein the dim-witted Great Dane, and Rita, a Saluki who tries to serve as the voice of reason. They're all fine, if not particularly memorable.
* I'm not sure what the dogs are trying to do with the Foxworth family's limousine. Tito is hotwiring it...Are they trying to steal it? Are they trying to steal the limousine? Are these dogs going to drive a limousine back to Fagin's?
* Georgette (Bette Midler), for all her flaws, is actually fairly likable. She's a spoiled, prize-winning poodle who isn't at all happy to see Oliver join the Foxworth household, and who attempts to get rid of him at first opportunity. She redeems herself later on, however, and, like Tinker Bell in *Peter Pan*, it's just hard to hate her, even when she's being malicious. Her song, 'Perfect Isn't Easy', is a good number.
* Like a good dog, Dodger defends Fagin at the meeting with Sykes, sustaining a rough beating from the two Dobermans. The climactic chase scene, in which Sykes pursues the good guys in his car on the subway tracks, is exciting, if a bit silly. (How mad do you have to be to drive your car down the stairs, onto the tracks, and into the tunnel?) Both Dobermans fall onto the tracks and are electrocuted, and Sykes is annihilated by an onrushing train.

**In Conclusion**

*Oliver & Company* is a decent enough film, and it certainly has its strong points, but I'm afraid it's typical of Disney's animated efforts during this era; mediocre, unspectacular, ultimately forgettable. Over the course of the past thirty years, only a precious few WDAS films have really stood out from a pack of blandness. Good news, though; we've finally reached the Disney Renaissance, with *The Little Mermaid* up next! This is going to be fun!

**Overview**

Based on the Basil of Baker Street series of children's novels (which, in turn, were based on Sherlock Holmes), *The Great Mouse Detective* follows the adventures of Basil (named after famed Sherlock Holmes actor Basil Rathbone, of course), who lives in Holmes' basement and solves cases brought to him by the rodent community. It was successful both critically and commercially, and, in the wake of the disaster that was *The Black Cauldron*, it revitalized WDAS and very probably saved the studio.

**Point by Point**

* Basil is just as brilliant as Holmes at deductive reasoning, and also just as eccentric and socially awkward. It takes Dawson and Olivia time to get through to him, and he only really becomes interested in the case of Olivia's missing father when he realizes that he can link it to his nemesis, Professor Ratigan.
* 'The World's Greatest Criminal Mind' is a good instance of character development set to music; that's what songs in musicals really ought to be for. Basil has already talked Ratigan up as the Napoleon of crime, but now we get to know him firsthand. In particular we see that he is a rat with a sort of self-hatred complex, and insists that he is actually just a large mouse. When one of his men makes the mistake of referring to him as a rat, Ratigan feeds him to Felicia, his pet cat.
* *The Great Mouse Detective* isn't overly exciting, though it does have some good sequences, including the action scene in the toy shop, the investigation at the seedy tavern, and the escape from Ratigan's death trap. The climactic scene inside of Big Ben, set against a black void of clicking, grinding gears, is appropriately atmospheric. When Ratigan loses his temper he finally becomes a rat - all claws and teeth and hunched back - and the battle moves outside for an exciting finale on Big Ben's face.

**In Conclusion**

*The Great Mouse Detective* is okay. It's no masterpiece, and it's a little cheesy at times, but it has its charms, particularly for children and for fans of Sherlock Holmes. I wish I had more to say about it, but I think I've covered everything of note. Its greatest legacy is that it helped pave the way for the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s.

**Overview**

Of all the ranging and diverse movies turned out by Walt Disney Animation Studios over almost a century now, *The Black Cauldron* is probably the most obscure; the least beloved. Inspired loosely by *The Chronicles of Prydain*, a series of fantasy novels by Lloyd Alexander, it was possibly the studio's greatest misfire, and its expensive, spectacular failure actually cast doubt on the future of Disney animated films.

**Point by Point**

* Frankly, it's not difficult to see why *The Black Cauldron* failed to resonate with audiences. To start off, none of the characters are interesting or even particularly likable. Most of them are just generic cliches from the fantasy genre. There's the farm boy who wants to be a mighty warrior; there's a tagalong princess who isn't really good for anything; there's a comedy relief minstrel; and there's a weird, furry mascot who's strikingly similar to Gollum. And none of them are endowed with interesting personalities or histories. We don't learn what makes them tick. They don't deal with personal conflicts and grow into better people. They're just there because the story requires them to be there.
* And as for the story, it's astonishingly bland for a Disney movie. It's not as if the people at Disney didn't understand how to craft an effective narrative, yet it's boring and unengaging from beginning to end; no highs and lows to remark on, just one long, flat line of *blah*. There's a magic sword, but we're never told of its nature or its origin. There's supposed to be a romance brewing between the male protagonist and the princess, but their interactions are completely devoid of chemistry. The villain's goal is ill-defined (something about wanting to use the Cauldron to create an undead army), and, once achieved, is undone almost immediately. And Gurgi's self-sacrifice at the end fails to evoke any emotional response because, again, I don't care about *any* of these characters.
* And there aren't any songs either. Now, that's not innately a bad thing. WDAS has turned out some great films over the years that haven't been reliant on musical numbers, but the lack of music and whimsy here does the already lackluster *Black Cauldron* no favors.

**In Conclusion**

*The Black Cauldron* is such a dramatic departure from what you'd expect from a Disney animated movie. It simply doesn't have anything to recommend it, and it deserves its place in relative obscurity. It's easily the weakest film in the WDAS canon. I'd even rank it below the anthology films of the 1940s, because at least those made me smile.

**Overview**

Though it's not apparent from an aesthetic standpoint, *The Fox and the Hound* marked the end of an era at Disney. The core animators and creative talents who had been working diligently for Walt Disney since before *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* all retired on this project, necessitating an influx of new blood. Most of these had been trained in-house, but the generational gap led to significant creative disputes, which led in turn to production delays. Notably, Don Bluth (who had previously worked on *Robin Hood*, *The Rescuers*, and *Pete's Dragon*) resigned, took a bunch of other animators with him, and set up his own production company. Throughout the 1980s Bluth would produce and release *The Secret of NIMH*, *An American Tail*, *The Land Before Time*, and *All Dogs Go to Heaven*, all of which are regarded highly today.

**Point by Point**

* The opening of *The Fox and the Hound* is eerie and tense, with a hunted mother fox carrying her baby as she flees the hounds. She drops him at the farm owned by the Widow Tweed, and is killed almost immediately afterwards. Big Mama, a kind owl, arranges for the fox to be adopted by the Widow, who names him Tod. At just about the same time, her neighbor Amos Slade brings home Copper, a new bloodhound pup.
* Tod and Copper are both cute, and it's fun to watch them play. Of course, chaos ensues the first time Slade and his other dog, Chief, discover Tod on their property. (Slade isn't the villain of the story. He's kind of a dick, and he has an itchy trigger finger, but he's not evil.)
* After Slade and the dogs return from a months long hunting trip, Tod and Copper - both adults now - have a brief reunion, during which Copper expresses happiness at seeing Tod, but informs him that their erstwhile friendship can't continue. The scene abruptly turns to a chase when Chief notices Tod. Slade and the two dogs chase Tod into hiding; Copper corners him, but allows him to escape. Immediately after this, Chief chases Tod onto a railroad trestle and into the path of a train. The train strikes Chief, and Copper - angry at himself for having let Tod escape - vows revenge.
* Chief survives his run-in with the train, getting away with just a broken leg. This served as one of the aforementioned bones of contention between the older filmmakers (who balked at killing Chief off) and the younger (who maintained the conflict didn't make sense if Chief survived). Personally, I think the story would have been better served by Chief's death, but I get it. Children's entertainment is evolving all the time, and, in 1981, Disney simply wasn't ready to give us a Mufasa moment. They hadn't come quite that far yet.
* With Slade gunning for Tod, the Widow has no choice but to release him onto the nearby game preserve, where she imagines he'll be safe. It's sad, because she's saying goodbye to her beloved pet and companion, who she raised from a cub. Of course, Tod isn't used to living wild, and he has a rough first night of it. The next day, with Big Mama's help, he meets Vixey, a lovely female fox, and things begin to look brighter.
* Slade and Copper, in their wrath, are willing to trespass on the game preserve and poach Tod. After a chase, and some scuffling between Tod and Copper, a huge grizzly bear appears out of nowhere and attacks Slade and Copper. Slade, with his foot caught in one of his own traps and his gun out of reach, is defenseless, and Copper has the fight knocked out of him. Tod could be well and away with Vixey and leave his pursuers to their fate, but, because of what Copper once was to him, he goes back and attacks the bear on their behalf.
* The moment after the fight with the bear, when Copper steps in front of Tod to shield him from Slade...I don't believe that's simply a matter of ""Well, he saved our lives, so I'll save his"", although that's certainly part of it. Copper doesn't growl and snarl at his master; he isn't taking a rebellious, disloyal stand. He looks at Slade gently, imploringly, as if to say, ""Dad, we have to let this go. Tod hurt us, but killing him doesn't accomplish anything. We have to let go of this rage and this hatred, if only for our own sakes. This isn't us, Dad. Let's go home."" Judging by the softening and ultimately accepting expression on Slade's face, the message gets through.

**In Conclusion**

Following on from *The Rescuers*, *The Fox and the Hound* is another dark-ish Disney film, with some slightly heavier themes than those found in *One Hundred and One Dalmatians*, *The Sword in the Stone*, or *Robin Hood*. It's the kind of film your kids can learn from as they grow older. Though I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, I'd say it holds up.

"Your thoughts on ""The Rescuers"" (1977)","https://preview.redd.it/i4b1cirejj6b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2d39013b0d6a7757aa7676b31f8fab529d891ca

**Overview**

Taking light inspiration from a series of children's books by author Margery Sharp, *The Rescuers* is a fairly low-key, straightforward adventure film that just happens to star two talking mice. It received near universal acclaim from critics and was a box office success, and this would lead to a sequel being released thirteen years later.

**Point by Point**

* *The Rescuers* gets straight to the point. The very first thing we see onscreen is a little girl aboard a shadowy riverboat down on the bayou, tiptoeing past a couple of sinister-looking crocodiles and dropping a bottled plea for rescue into the water. The opening credits play over still paintings of the bottle being tossed over waves and through storms, while the moody song 'The Journey' plays, until it reaches New York City.
* Bernard and Bianca are both immediately likable protagonists, with personalities that compliment each other. Bernard is a worrywart, and Bianca tends to fly by the seat of her pants. This makes for a good ""odd couple"" dynamic between the two.
* While Bernard and Bianca are searching for clues at the orphanage from which Penny disappeared, we're treated to a flashback sequence that introduces us to Penny. She's a sad little girl who just wants to be adopted by some nice couple, and it's easy to sympathize right away with her. She's cute, but not obnoxiously so.
* At one point during the movie's development, there was the idea to have Cruella de Vil return and serve as the villain. This notion was ultimately scrapped, of course, but Madame Medusa is Cruella in all but name, from the trashy clothes to the bad temper to the horrific driving skills. And though she's a relatively obscure and unremarkable figure in Disney's pantheon of villains, Madame Medusa might be one of the studio's most despicable. Characters like Maleficent and Ursula are pure evil, of course, but they're just pretend. Nobody like them exists in real life. Medusa, on the other hand, is emblematic of a very real evil in this world; she's a cruel, ruthless person who will exploit and abuse a child to get what she wants. Sadly, there are children actually watching *The Rescuers* who have been victimized by Medusas of their own.
* *The Rescuers* definitely has the look of its time, but it stands out from other contemporary Disney releases with an overall darker, perhaps even muddier tone to its visuals, which fits its settings (New York City and the swamp) to a T. The backgrounds are particularly striking and colorful in an unconventional way. We hardly see any blue sky, for example. The scenes in New York are set against a smoggy sunset, and the sky above Devil's Bayou is a sulfuric yellow. It's very moody.
* *The Rescuers* has some amusing ideas in general; using an albatross as an airplane and a dragonfly as an outboard motor, and the sequence where the crocodiles ""play"" the pipe organ in order to get Bernard and Bianca out of the pipes.
* The sequence down in the pirates' cave is tense and suspenseful, and with an appropriate air of encroaching doom as the tide begins to surge in. We really do feel the urgency as Penny and the mice search for the large diamond, and then the triumph as they find it.
* The climax is action-packed, with various friendly swamp critters getting in on the act, attacking Medusa and setting off fireworks. The riverboat sinks, and the good guys get away on Medusa's ""swamp mobile"". Satisfyingly, Medusa's crocodiles turn on her.

**In Conclusion**

I'm inclined to agree with the reviewers of the time. *The Rescuers*, while not anything overly special, appears to be constructed with more artistry, originality, and heart than the past several Disney films, and is probably the best one since *Sleeping Beauty*. I enjoyed the characters and themes, and found the aesthetic choices in visual style and music enhanced the story.

**Overview**

*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh* is a compilation of three short Pooh features that had been produced and released by Disney in the preceding years; *Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree* (1966), *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day* (1968), and *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too* (1974). There's been a lot of Pooh-related media since, especially after the 1997 movie *Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin* sparked his popularity. Today Pooh is a multimedia franchise unto himself, but it all started with these earnest adaptations.

**Point by Point**

* The Pooh features honor their literary origins with a unique storybook format that allows for whimsical visual gags, occasionally showing the characters interacting with the words on the page or speaking with the narrator. It wouldn't work with most other characters, but it seems to fit Pooh and his friends just right.
* *Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree* is pretty basic, serving as an introduction to Pooh and his world. We see him perform his ""stoutness exercises"" (which only enhance his appetite), cooperate with Christopher Robin to try and trick some bees out of their honey, and eat Rabbit out of house and home, only to get himself stuck in the front door when he tries to leave. There are some good bits there, like Rabbit trying to adapt Pooh's rear end to his home decor, and Gopher (an original Disney character) repeatedly saying, ""I'm not in the book, you know.""
* *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day* is more dynamic, with more action. We see Piglet blown through the air like a kite with Pooh hanging on, we see Owl's tree blow over and crash to the ground, and we meet the boisterous, rambunctious Tigger. The dream Pooh has about Heffalumps and Woozles is bizarre, and calls to mind 'Pink Elephants on Parade' from *Dumbo*. Then, of course, there's the rainstorm that floods the Hundred Acre Wood.
* *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too* is good as well, but I think it's the least eventful and the least colorful of the three segments. Most of the focus is on how annoyed Rabbit is with getting repeatedly assaulted by Tigger.

**In Conclusion**

*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh* is strictly kids' stuff (and, considering the source material, that's hardly a surprise), but its whimsy and gentle humor makes it an enjoyable diversion for adult fans as well. I found myself smiling and chuckling in all the right places. Generally speaking, Pooh isn't something you hold onto as you grow older, but it can still be fun to go back and visit.

"Your thoughts on ""Robin Hood"" (1973)"," 

https://preview.redd.it/mmvbndpitx5b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c20b4d55c32afe48c76e80d13d26064bb9f7577

**Overview**

There have been many, many film adaptations of the legend of Robin Hood over the decades. This, along with the films starring Errol Flynn and Kevin Costner, is one of the more famous ones, and it uses an all-animal cast to achieve that uniquely Disney flair.

**Point by Point**

* Notably, Robin Hood doesn't lead a band of ""Merry Men"" in this one; it's just him and Little John, working together as a duo. Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale both appear as well, of course, but not as members of Robin's personal army. You would think this would come off as a glaring oversight, but, for the purposes of this particular movie, the two-man team of Robin and Little John suffices quite well. The characters have a good dynamic, and play well off of each other.
* Prince John, as voiced by Peter Ustinov, is a petty, sniveling coward with mommy issues, and hopelessly jealous of his brother Richard, the true king. For a villain who appears to have almost absolute power over England, he doesn't come off as very threatening. Definitely one of the most pathetic of Disney's antagonists.
* Of all the Robin Hood movies, I feel like this one might actually do more than any other to demonstrate the romantic feelings between Robin and Maid Marian. They're very lovey-dovey with each other, and there's even a slow, lilting song about it.
* The archery tournament (a staple of the Robin Hood legend) is a pretty good sequence, as is the chaotic brawl that follows.
* 'The Phony King of England' is a catchy number, but most of the animation done for the dance is recycled from prior Disney movies like *Snow White* and *The Jungle Book*. This isn't the first time that Disney animators resorted to this shortcut, but, having watched all of these in a row, I found it particularly noticeable.
* Throughout the film, we see the peasants of Nottingham taxed to their limit, robbed of their last few farthings and then thrown in jail on top of it. As ridiculous a figure as Prince John is, he has the power to make his subjects' lives utterly miserable. The current of underlying desperation is embodied in Friar Tuck when he finally loses his temper and attacks the Sheriff. As a clergyman he must be keenly aware of the suffering all around him, and he's simply had all he can take. He snaps. It's not as if any good was ever going to come out of it. Friar Tuck wasn't going to defeat the Sheriff and free the people from tyranny and get everyone their money back. His arrest and incarceration was the only realistic result. For a fairly simple, kid-oriented story, I think *Robin Hood* does a good job in this instance of showing that people, when pushed too far, are capable of behaving irrationally and even violently.
* The jailbreak sequence is reasonably suspenseful, and the climax is exciting enough, with Robin on his own against all the guards and trying desperately to find a way out of the castle. It gets even more heated (pun intended) when the Sheriff sets fire to one of the towers, and Robin, surrounded by flames, has to leap from the roof.

**In Conclusion**

Like the last few Disney movies we've seen, *Robin Hood* has more to offer children than it does adults. It's a decent adventure with some trademark Disney charm, and an excellent introduction to the Robin Hood legend for kids. As with most Disney films of its era, however, it lacks the artistry, complexity, and refinement that will make an adult viewer sit up and take notice.

**Overview**

Occurring in between 1959's *Sleeping Beauty* and 1989's *The Little Mermaid* is an era of Disney films that are mostly middle to lower tier. They're not bad - in fact, many of them are regarded today as classics - but they don't do much to push the storytelling and technical boundaries of the genre. They're safe, unspectacular projects, and mostly just for kids. Within this sphere of fairly run-of-the-mill animation falls *The Aristocats*.

**Point by Point**

* There isn't really much to say about *The Aristocats*. It's definitely a kids' film, unlikely to appeal all that much to adults. Whereas the best Disney movies cast a net that can ensnare all ages and demographics, *The Aristocats* simply doesn't have much to offer a viewer who's grown beyond a certain age. The kittens are pretty cute, and the sequences with the two dogs are good for a laugh. 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat' is a decent number, but a very far cry from the best of Disney's song catalog.
* Edgar, the butler and antagonist, doesn't betray any signs of malevolence or villainy at first. In fact, he's perfectly cordial and accommodating, serving with a smile on his face, and patiently tolerant of nuisances. It's only after he's learned that he's being undercut in the will by the cats that his more roguish side comes out. As a consequence, he does an evil thing. However, I don't think he's evil at his core. He allows his greed and desperation to get the better of him.
* Phil Harris returns from his work on *The Jungle Book* to voice Thomas O'Malley, with that same John Wayne-esque tone and inflection he brought to Baloo. He's definitely a different character, though. In fact, he's more like Tramp; a streetwise lothario with a heart of gold.

**In Conclusion**

So, that's *The Aristocats*; inoffensive, unimpressive, and decidedly for young children.

Fullscreen on next episode,"Exiting full screen on next episode autoplay annoyed me so much that I decided to fix it. With the use of Tampermonkey extension ([Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)) it can be done by using the following script: [gist link](https://gist.github.com/Avgariat/71ac60e854094079b9d1a4eb4698535c)

Warning: **Do not use scripts found on the internet** with Tampermonkey if you haven't reviewed them. They may be malicious. I understand the same goes for my script so I guess you should wait for some people to review it in the comments before using it.

&#x200B;

A little background for anyone interested:

So I investigated why it's exiting Fullscreen at all. As it turns out Disney made it on purpose and they use [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API) to make it happen.

The script linked above blocks exiting the Fullscreen if the user didn't click on anything within 0.5s. Using ESC to exit Fullscreen does not trigger an event so doing so is not blocked. I've only tested it on Opera and it seems to work so it should work on other modern browsers. However, it's not guaranteed.

A Recent Customer Service Experience,"So my wife and I share an account together, and we have one profile. Our account has a pretty strong password and we're security minded usually. Outside of logging in our account in maybe one other place ever we don't share our account information, and we don't share the account with anyone currently. 

Recently we had a new profile pop up on our account. In response we changed the password, logged off all devices from our account using the built-in feature, removed the profile, and logged back in. We figured good enough probably. Guess not. Last week new shows started appearing in the ""recently watched"" section, shows that neither of us had watched. So I went to the customer service chat and tried to figure out if we could get confirmation that the heartbeat functionality had worked. 

Our customer service rep told me to do all the steps I had previously, the only new step was adding a pin to the profile. He told me he has no way of confirming that the process worked. I asked if that meant if it doesn't work, would somebody just have unfettered access to our account? He said Yes. I told him that wasn't good enough, that I would need an escalation. He said no problem and 1 minute later pastes in the same instruction and says ""that's what they said to do"". 

This feels an awful lot like Disney doesn't care at all if my account is unsecured, and then anything attached to my account feels like it's in an unnecessary risk space (credit card info? personal info?). Pursuing escalation to confirm that the security apparatus works results in some L1 tech telling me twice that it's good enough. Am I in the wrong for being worried about account security here?

T.J Detweiler: Come on Anne? It was a good prank.

Anne Boonchuy: Really especially when it makes me and my parents’ hotel look bad! Man if your parents heard about this they would be just as mad as I am.

Ellie Detweiler (walks in): Not by a long shot, all T.J was doing is being a boy, I mean, ever heard the phrase, “boys will be boys”. 

Anne Boonchuy: Really what about “what’s good for businesses”.

Ellie Detweiler: Come on Anne, so T.J made a mistake, I mean a talking to would have suffice but going Tony Soprano on him is a little excessive. just let it slide.

"D+: ""Cancel your account. We don't want your money.""","**TL;DR** \- After 5 hours of attempting to updated my billing information via the Android app, then via the a desktop browser, then via a phone call to customer service, and finally via ""customer support"" chat, Disney Plus essentially told me they are not interested in my money.

Full story:

Several weeks ago, my credit card was compromised, and I began seeing fraudulent charges pop up. I contacted my CC issuer, and they canceled the card and sent me a new one.

It was a little annoying, especially since I use this CC for nearly all subscriptions, but I figured I would just update them as the due dates came around and I received the notifications.

My D+ sub was on May 28, and I never received anything (and honestly, I wasn't tracking it that closely anyway). I just knew that, at some point, I would get the email that said, ""Hey, please update your billing info.""

That email from D+ was not a heads up, but rather more of a threat. (See screenshot.)

&#x200B;

[D+ Threat](https://preview.redd.it/rh17ghtwz25b1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=f361b6a3c6a0f18ebc1fa1615a939dfb22795a01)

Unfortunately, I was traveling at the time and had not been keeping a close eye on email. By the time I saw the email about 24 hours after it hit my inbox, it was already too late.

That **Update Payment Information** request was no longer valid, and so began the long, arduous trek through the D+ ""customer support"" jungle.

After multiple attempts to update my payment information via the mobile app and via desktop browser, I finally called D+ support number.

The first call immediately disconnected.

The second call resulted in a long hold time, where I was told my account was on hold and would need to be canceled completely. To the rep's credit, she asked me what had been my process to attempt to update the billing information, and as I was walking her through it, that call also abruptly disconnected.

I finally made another call and also got into the chat queue (25th in line), and I figured I would just talk to whomever answered first.

It was chat.

The chat rep was kind and patient and attempted to empathize, but by the end (even after escalating it), told me the same thing - ""Sorry, we will need to completely cancel your account.""  


**Summary:** For the life of me, I can't imagine why D+ makes it so difficult to give them money. Perhaps it is about the cost to run the servers and maintain accounts, etc. (makes sense), but giving a user less than 24 hours to correct a payment issue seems extreme.

Overall, I have loved my D+ subscription. I was an early adopter, subscribing nearly as soon as the service was available, and yet, this most recent debacle has put a bit of a blemish on the service's reputation, if only through my own eyes.",0,0.27,3,ritual_tradition,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1686355920.0,False,False,False,2023-06-10 00:12:00,tldr after hours of attempting to updated my billing information via the android app then via the a desktop browser then via a phone call to customer service and finally via customer support chat disney plus essentially told me they are not interested in my money full story several weeks ago my credit card was compromised and i began seeing fraudulent charges pop up i contacted my cc issuer and they canceled the card and sent me a new one it was a little annoying especially since i use this cc for nearly all subscriptions but i figured i would just update them as the due dates came around and i received the notifications my d sub was on may and i never received anything and honestly i wasnt tracking it that closely anyway i just knew that at some point i would get the email that said hey please update your billing info that email from d was not a heads up but rather more of a threat see screenshot d threat unfortunately i was traveling at the time and had not been keeping a close eye on email by the time i saw the email about hours after it hit my inbox it was already too late that update payment information request was no longer valid and so began the long arduous trek through the d customer support jungle after multiple attempts to update my payment information via the mobile app and via desktop browser i finally called d support number the first call immediately disconnected the second call resulted in a long hold time where i was told my account was on hold and would need to be canceled completely to the reps credit she asked me what had been my process to attempt to update the billing information and as i was walking her through it that call also abruptly disconnected i finally made another call and also got into the chat queue th in line and i figured i would just talk to whomever answered first it was chat the chat rep was kind and patient and attempted to empathize but by the end even after escalating it told me the same thing sorry we will need to completely cancel your account summary for the life of me i cant imagine why d makes it so difficult to give them money perhaps it is about the cost to run the servers and maintain accounts etc makes sense but giving a user less than hours to correct a payment issue seems extreme overall i have loved my d subscription i was an early adopter subscribing nearly as soon as the service was available and yet this most recent debacle has put a bit of a blemish on the services reputation if only through my own eyes,d cancel your account we dont want your money,1
"Your thoughts on ""The Jungle Book"" (1967)"," 

https://preview.redd.it/cxoiw3stzt4b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a690e3398d5f5d540bac2dfe3af7ed483235e09

**Overview**

Inspired by the Mowgli stories of Rudyard Kipling, *The Jungle Book* has the distinction of being the last animated feature Walt Disney worked on before his death. After suffering some degree of disenchantment with animation and taking a less active role in *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* and *The Sword in the Stone*, Disney seemed to regain some of his old enthusiasm with this latest project, and who knows what that might have led to in the future?

**Point by Point**

* Undertaking this viewing of *The Jungle Book* with a consciously more critical eye, I was surprised right away by how static and lifeless the visuals appeared. Watching all these Disney features in a row like this inevitably invites comparison, and, to be honest, this seems like a step backwards. I'd expected a lot more from a steaming jungle environment. I don't get a sense of the backgrounds teeming with life; Mowgli just seems to be walking through a drawing most of the time. And the animals - especially when compared to those in *Bambi* or *Lady and the Tramp* \- don't seem particularly lifelike. Bagheera, in particular, looks more like a walking sack of flour than a lithe and muscular cat.
* The story starts out pretty slow, too. The characters just aren't very interesting overall. For someone who grew up there, Mowgli seems way too naive about the jungle. He ought to know all about its dangers and its secrets, but, in general, he behaves like he got dropped off just yesterday. I don't care for Sterling Holloway's take on Kaa, and even Shere Khan exhudes far less menace than he did when I was a kid. Things pick up when Baloo enters the picture, and 'The Bare Necessities' has become one of Disney's signature songs. I don't really buy Mowgli and Baloo's relationship becoming so close so quickly, however. It feels inorganic.
* The sequence at the ancient ruins is pretty good, with King Louie singing and dancing, and Baloo disguising himself as an ape, and the fight that ultimately brings down the house. Some scolds have called King Louie a racist caricature of a black man, but that's not what Disney was going for. In fact, they declined to cast Louis Armstrong in the role (and cast white musician Louis Prima) precisely to avoid such accusations.
* The vultures, of course, are based on the Beatles, complete with mop-top haircuts and British accents. Originally the filmmakers had wanted the actual Beatles to voice the vultures, but John Lennon didn't want to do it. Considering that Beatlemania was pretty much at its peak at the time, I can't help but wonder what the reaction in the audience would have been.
* Mowgli being lured back to civilization by his first sight of a pretty girl is a very apt way to end the story. You can't fight nature.

**In Conclusion**

I've seen *The Jungle Book* many times in my life, and I've always enjoyed it well enough, and there's no question that it's become one of Disney's more iconic and beloved stories. But this time it just didn't stick the landing for me; this time I found it rather bland, and lacking in energy. Compared to most of the other Disney movies I've watched during this run so far, it just doesn't pop. To be honest, I think the 2016 remake does just about everything better. Reluctantly, I'm going to have to assign it a lower spot in my ranking.

It’s disappointing because it’s not the actual Disney+ service. It’s Hotstar X. Not a lot has been changed since then. I just hope that Disney migrate the accounts to the main streaming service and just stop using Hotstar as a Disney+ service, because it’s an inferior service.

Chinese-Born Americans,"I just started watching this. I don't know if my race and age matter, because I don't always like everything at younger or different people. I like many wholesome types of movies or series on Disney+. I like the MCU, StarWars, a few drama series, and a lot of comedy series.

Now if you might like some of those or just want to try something where you don't really know if you'll like it, I began to watch the new series, ""Chinese-Born Americans.""

So far, it's a great story, with some characters I'm enjoying. I like some of the asian themed in the setting, characters. I enjoy martial arts in movies and series. Also, both Ke Huy Quan, and Michelle Yeoh. They are my two highest asian actors that I love.

And beside that, Michelle Yeoh actually plays Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, who has a great ""life"" in the historical stories about her.

So far, I'm going close to binge this series LOL.

"Your thoughts on ""The Sword in the Stone"" (1963)"," 

https://preview.redd.it/ee6qz0rd5g4b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=971449d3202978b8ce88cd69542d8ea7327d2925

**Overview**

Based on the Arthurian novel by T.H. White, *The Sword in the Stone* chronicles the adventures of young King Arthur with Merlin, in the days immediately before he pulled the sword from the stone and proved himself the rightful heir to the throne of England. It received mixed reviews, but was a box office success, and was the last of the WDAS features to be released during Walt Disney's lifetime.

**Point by Point**

* We open on England enduring ""a Dark Age; without law and without order"". No king sits on the throne. Deep in the forest lives Merlin, a likable and eccentric character whose absentmindedness and occasional clumsiness make him more endearing than if he were played completely straight. As he can see clear visions of the future, and also travel through time, he frequently makes reference to anachronistic things like airplanes, steam engines, and indoor plumbing, none of which the other characters are familiar with. He's a bit like a forebear of the Genie from *Aladdin*. Like that character, Merlin's magical nature provides ample opportunity for comedy and winks to the audience.
* Even Merlin doesn't appear to know why Arthur - or Wart, as he's called here - is important; all he knows is that fate has thrust the boy into his care. So he sets out to educate Wart, primarily through adventures in the forms of various animals. The sequence in the moat - with Merlin and Wart transforming into fish - focuses on the laws of physics, and eventually becomes a lesson in the principle of brains over brawn when a much bigger, more predatory fish shows up.
* Quickly following is the squirrel sequence, which begins as a lesson in the law of gravity, but ultimately imparts some wisdom about love too. Watching the girl squirrel fall in love with Wart's squirrel form is funny and cute, and the situation only becomes more comedic when Merlin manages to attract a prospective mate of his own. (I kind of feel bad for the skinny, mangy wolf that's been dogging Wart's steps, trying to get a bite, only to be met with calamity. He's not evil, he just needs something to eat.)
* The wizards' duel between Merlin and Madam Mim is fun and full of energy, and probably the highlight of the movie. Mim cheats frequently and flagrantly, and turns into various predators, while Merlin sticks mostly to meeker forms like a mouse, a rabbit, and a Billy goat. He still manages to outsmart her, proving to Wart his earlier point about brains over brawn.
* I think Merlin overreacts a bit when Wart becomes Kay's squire. It's not a permanent position, after all. He can still continue his education. There's no need for Merlin to blow himself to Bermuda over it. Of course, it was all supposed to be this way, because if Wart hadn't been Kay's squire, then he wouldn't have forgotten Kay's sword at the inn, and he wouldn't have ended up pulling the sword from the stone and fulfilling his destiny.

**In Conclusion**

*The Sword in the Stone* is a good bit of fun, but, compared to most other films in the WDAS canon, it's on the weaker side of things. The narrative isn't very strong or cohesive, none of the characters have become stand-outs in Disney mythology, and the song catalog is severely lacking, with just a few brief, forgettable tunes. I like it, but I think it's comparatively low-tier.

Still no app on MacOS,"I have been an owner of a Macbook for the last 2 years. I am not demanding something huge. Watching content with 1080p, on the browser I want to use, and being able to download and watch it on the go.

I do not blame them or attack them on anyway but I just want to understand why there is no progress about the solution of my problem.

I have tried everything I can to fix my problems. I switched to Safari, even though I hate it, to watch content with a better resolution.

**Overview**

At this point in his life, Walt Disney was becoming disenchanted with feature-length animation. *Sleeping Beauty* had been a long, exhausting, and expensive production, and, although Walt had wanted it to become his masterpiece, neither critics nor audiences rewarded him for it. Walt had a soft spot for animation - it had formed the foundation of his company - but he had lots of other irons in the fire now, and he was thinking of just chucking the part of the biz that had begun with *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*. Fortunately for children everywhere, *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* was not only a hit with the public, but had cost much less to produce, largely thanks to the use of Xerox photography. (Imagine having to animate every spot on every dog!) If *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* had not been a success, things today might look very different.

**Point by Point**

* The opening credits sequence is a departure from the norm; playful and lively, with lots of playing into the theme of spots. On the whole, the film's visual style is noticeably distinct from every other feature that had gone before. Where *Snow White* and *Bambi* and *Sleeping Beauty* look like paintings, *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* is more evocative of a newspaper comic strip. Both the backgrounds and the characters are defined by thick, black outlines and angular corners, and some of the scenery even looks like painted cardboard in a stage production. It's a conscious difference in style that really sets the film apart from its predecessors.
* Cruella de Vil bursts onto the scene and immediately takes command of the movie with her loud, bombastic presence. Her stark black-and-white hair, her perpetual scowl, the clouds of sickly green smoke fuming from her cigarette; her exaggerated fur coat that makes her look much bigger than she is, and consequently more threatening. It's no wonder she's become one of the most iconic villains in cinema.
* And appearing again just moments after Perdita has finished delivering her puppies, framed in the doorway by a flash of lightning. Like the summoning of a demon. She's just *there*!
* Jasper and Horace Baddun are effective co-villains with Cruella; bumbling, but nasty and cutthroat, and it's highly satisfying to see them beaten up by Pongo and Perdita during the puppies' spectacular escape from Cruella's old manor house.
* The climactic sequence - in which the Dalmatians disguise themselves as Labradors in order to sneak past Cruella and the Badduns and onto a waiting truck - evokes the proper air of suspense and urgency, and leads straight into an exciting vehicular chase during which Cruella trashes her car and really lets her crazy come out.

**In Conclusion**

*One Hundred and One Dalmatians* is a fun movie with an interesting look and a memorable villain, but it doesn't have as much substance as most other Disney films, and it's pretty anemic in the music department. (Roger's jazzy hit 'Cruella de Vil' is really the only notable number the film has.) And, as a talking dog movie, I'd say it's inferior to *Lady and the Tramp*. It's an important film in the WDAS canon, but I can't rank it among their greatest hits.

**Overview**

Walt Disney was excited about *Sleeping Beauty*. He envisioned it as his masterpiece. It took almost a decade to produce, and the process cost six million dollars, making it the most expensive Disney animated film yet. It had to struggle through numerous production delays and changes in creative direction, and, when all was said and done, it was a box office failure. But there are a lot of great movies in this world that started out that way and went on to become absolute legends, and *Sleeping Beauty* is one of them.

**Point by Point**

* Naturally, the first aspect of *Sleeping Beauty* that really hits is the visuals. With a tapestry-like art style inspired by pre-Renaissance European art, the distinctive look of *Sleeping Beauty* is the most refined and most detailed yet, with even the backgrounds appearing unique and intricate. I've said before that *Sleeping Beauty* is the *Beauty and the Beast* of its day, it looks that damn good.
* *Sleeping Beauty* is also a standout in the audio department. Most of the film's music is actually adapted from the Tchaikovsky ballet *The Sleeping Beauty*, rather than being wholly original. It wasn't easy to do (George Bruns, the film's composer, spent three years on the project), but it ended up being a tremendously rewarding creative choice.
* The film is striking from the very start, with the bright and colorful introduction set to 'Hail to the Princess Aurora'. It really succeeds in capturing that medieval flavor. Then we meet Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, the three good fairies who will prove central to the plot.
* There can be no question that Maleficent is one of the greatest villains in the Disney canon. Some villains are buffoonish, like Captain Hook. Some are nasty but petty, like Cruella de Vil. Some are pure evil, but tempered with humor, like Hades. And some others - like Scar and Frollo - are sinister and threatening, but pathetic at their core. Maleficent, however, towers above these. She is fearsome and intimidating, regal and commanding, seemingly without weakness of any kind, and evil purely for its own sake.
* Watching the fairies try to prepare for Aurora's sixteenth birthday party - making a dress and a cake, both of which turn out to be abortions - without the aid of magic is always good for a laugh, and it's just as entertaining watching them use their magic once they've finally given up. The former sequence is pure comedy, and the latter sequence provides the thrilling whimsy the audience has come to expect from a Disney movie.
* Watching Aurora strolling through the forest and singing to her animal friends is bound to invite comparison to Snow White and Cinderella, but I think the sequence stands well on its own, and isn't overly derivative. Plus, 'Once Upon a Dream' is easily one of the best Disney songs of its era.
* The 'Skumps' scene, with Stefan and Hubert toasting the imminent marriage of their children, is another good comedic bit. The revelry turns abruptly to an argument, then back to revelry just as quickly. One gets the impression this happens a lot between these two old friends.
* Of course, Aurora isn't dealing well with the sudden revelation that she's a princess by birth and betrothed to a prince, so the fairies make the fatal mistake of leaving her alone in the tower for a few moments. This is the part where *Sleeping Beauty* turns momentarily into a horror movie. Maleficent appears in the shadows of the room like a malign spirit. Without a word, she puts Aurora forcibly into a trance and lures her dreamily from the room, into a dark and desolate part of the castle that appears to have been sealed off and forgotten ages ago. The eerie, ominous music that plays over this sequence makes the proceedings that much more sinister. (Ever tried walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night with this theme playing in your head? I have.)
* King Stefan ordered all spinning wheels destroyed years ago, so Maleficent simply conjures one out of thin air. And with the trance that Aurora is in, she doesn't even have the choice. Maleficent might as well be holding her by the wrist and thrusting her finger onto the spindle herself, it's that forceful. It really drives home the point that there was no avoiding this outcome. It was always going to happen.
* In an ethereal sequence set to the lilting song 'Sleeping Beauty', the good fairies put the entire kingdom to sleep until a solution to Aurora's predicament can be found. When they realize that Prince Phillip can break the curse, they have to go rescue him from Maleficent's lair on the Forbidden Mountain. Maleficent's domain is Gothic and foreboding; grim, twisted, and hellish, with extremely atmospheric music to match.
* Maleficent's triumphal monologue to the imprisoned Phillip really makes clear her utter contempt and loathing for everything pure and good. In a recounting of the situation that's *dripping* with sarcasm, she taunts Phillip with her plan to keep him imprisoned for decades, only to set him free as an old man to finally awaken Aurora, who will still be just a child; to show that ""true love conquers all!"" I don't think that any other Disney villain has been characterized as well as Maleficent is in this single moment.
* Phillip and the fairies' escape from the Forbidden Mountain is an exciting and invigorating sequence, with Phillip fighting back the hordes of devils with his enchanted sword and shield, and the fairies using their powers to turn falling boulders into harmless bubbles and arrows into flowers. And Merryweather finally turning that squawking raven into stone is a triumphant moment in itself.
* They barely manage to escape, but Maleficent is determined that this story won't have a happy ending. She causes a thick forest of thorns to grow up all around Stefan's castle. When Phillip manages to get through even that, she flies to the scene herself. ""Now you deal with me, O Prince, and all the powers of *hell*!"" she cries, as she transforms into an immense, fire-breathing dragon.
* The duel between Phillip and the dragon is the climactic battle between good and evil; between love and hatred. With the forest of thorns burning all around, Phillip has no choice but to seek the high ground atop a cliff, from where the enchanted sword is hurled into the dragon's breast. For a movie that boasted no real action to speak of up until ten minutes ago, *Sleeping Beauty* delivers on excitement.
* After the spectacular fight, everything clears up. The thorns disappear, the sun rises. Phillip kisses Aurora, and everybody wakes up. Aurora and Phillip come down from the tower, happy, not speaking a word, and go out on a dance to 'Once Upon a Dream', with Aurora's gown changing from pink to blue and back again.

**In Conclusion**

There's no doubt that *Sleeping Beauty* is the best film in the line yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if it holds on to that spot at least until we reach the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s. It's so good that it'll doubtless take something like *The Little Mermaid* or *Beauty and the Beast* to topple it from its throne. This truly was Walt's masterpiece.

I think Disney + will close sooner than we expect,"The signs are already there, as Disney is currently trying to improve its numbers and making decissions.

Disney have amazing IPs but only a few of them are really good... And precisely the best ones are struggling right now, Star Wars, Classic remakes and Marvel, because people are tired of the mediocre last products. Yes, sometimes they get it right like with GoTGv3, but they are becoming the exception and not the rule.

Avatar is a juggernaut but Disney + can't rely on a IP that launches 1 product every 5 years. They need more and diverse content... The same content they are cutting.

Is it really Disney + what we need? Or what Disney needs right now? They are better off with putting their content in other streaming services, VOD or physical media formats rather than maintaining the infraestructure of a streaming platform. I don't know a lot about it but it should be very, very expensive.

Most people won't stand more raising prices while they are at the same time deleting content, and I think they know it.

The next natural decission will be to pull the plug. And after what they have done and what they have... I won't miss D+ at all. Marvel? I have my BDs. Star Wars? The same or VOD. The Classics? The same.

**Overview**

Full disclosure: I'm a dog person. I love dogs. They're pretty much my favorite animal, and I have one of my own. So obviously *Lady and the Tramp* is going to hit a bit differently for me than it would for someone who is indifferent to dogs. Interestingly, *Lady and the Tramp* is the first full-length feature in the WDAS canon that wasn't based on a pre-existing story. (Ostensibly, the movie was based on a short story that appeared in *Cosmopolitan* in 1945, entitled ""Happy Dan, the Cynical Dog"", but, having read that story, I can assure you that *Lady and the Tramp* is based on it in the same way that *Frozen* is based on *The Snow Queen*. Which is to say, not at all.)

**Point by Point**

* Lady is an adorable puppy, and you can tell that the Disney animators spent time studying real dogs for their work, because her movements and even her facial expressions (as well as those of the other dogs we'll meet) appear very true to life. Of course, little Lady doesn't want to be left in a room by herself for the night. Dogs aren't solitary creatures, they're pack animals. They want to be with the pack.
* Now Lady is six months old; still a pup, but maturing. She goes to show her shiny new license to her friends and we meet Jock (a Scottish terrier with a Scottish accent) and Trusty (a bloodhound who used to track criminals before he lost his sense of smell). Both are likable support characters.
* Now we transition to Tramp, a mutt living on the streets. He wouldn't usually be hanging out in Lady's affluent neighborhood, but, after springing a couple of friends from the dogcatcher and leading said dogcatcher on a chase, here he is. He interjects himself into a conversation between Lady and her friends about a baby that's coming soon. It's never explicitly stated, but it's still made quite clear that Tramp had a previous bad experience with a family that outgrew him. His warnings to Lady about the baby taking over and ultimately pushing the dog out echo his own misfortunes. He wasn't always a Tramp.
* Lady does have to endure a period during which she's mostly outside the sphere of her family's attention. Shortly after the baby is born, however, and everything has settled down a bit, we see that Jim Dear and Darling (as Lady knows them) are not the same as Tramp's erstwhile owners. When Lady sneaks into the nursery to see what all the fuss is about, she isn't scolded; she isn't seized by the scruff and thrown out. Instead her people pick her up gently and pet her and give her a chance to look at the baby. Clearly she's still part of the family.
* Aunt Sarah, on the other hand, only validates all of Tramp's prejudices against humans. When she comes to babysit, the first thing she does is shoo Lady out of the nursery. Of course, she's a cat person.
* That brings us to the Siamese cats; another problematic racial caricature, on the order of *Dumbo*'s crows and *Peter Pan*'s Indians. They're all slanted eyes, buckteeth, and malevolent intentions. (It's too late to do anything about it now. It is what it is. I'm blowing past it.) They begin causing mischief right away, and Lady tries in vain to stop them. It's when the cats make for the nursery that Lady gets aggressive, though. Most dogs are fiercely protective of their people's children, and Lady doesn't think these two cats should be around the baby.
* Of course, Aunt Sarah blames everything on Lady, and this ultimately leads to Lady becoming muzzled and lost on the streets, where Tramp saves her from a pack of vicious strays.
* The spaghetti and meatballs scene. Not only is it absolutely adorable, but it would be no exaggeration to call it one of the most iconic scenes in cinema.
* After a night of romance, Lady ends up getting snatched by a dogcatcher and taken to the pound. Obviously, the pound is a sad place, and we even see one scruffy boy taking ""the long walk"". It's also here that Lady is told a few choice details about Tramp's many ex-girlfriends.
* After Lady has been returned home (and chained up in the yard by Aunt Sarah), Tramp comes by to try and make up. Lady isn't in the mood, and tells him to leave. Shortly after he does so, Lady spies a big, ugly rat sneaking into the baby's room. Tramp hears her barking and returns, then, without hesitation, runs into the house himself to confront the invading rodent. This demonstrates that Tramp is a good boy. He has no personal stake in this, but he's not going to let the rat hurt the baby. (I've known some sweet, gentle rats in my time, but this particular specimen is a filthy, feral, yellow-eyed bugger, and no good can come of its proximity to a baby.) After a vicious scuffle, during which Tramp sustains a wound on his foot, the rat lays dead.
* Of course, Tramp's reward for his heroism is a ride in the back of the dogcatcher's wagon. Jim Dear and Darling arrive home just as Tramp is being carted away, and, despite Aunt Sarah's misinformed testimony, they're able to see the truth for themselves. Jock and Trusty chase after Tramp and spook the dogcatcher's horses, resulting in the wagon turning over. Even if they hadn't, however, Jim Dear is right behind them in his newfangled automobile. He doesn't want Tramp to be put down undeservedly.
* Now it's Christmas, and Tramp has a new home with Lady's family, and he and Lady have had some cute puppies, and everybody's happy. And Trusty isn't dead, he just busted his leg! That's great!

**In Conclusion**

A cute, happy, heartwarming story about dogs. It may not be Disney's greatest film, or its most beloved, but it's become a classic and a legend all the same. And, during this current run through the WDAS movies, it's the first one to really move me significantly. So, though many would disagree, I'm putting it at the top so far.

"Your thoughts on ""Peter Pan"" (1953)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

As with most of Disney's post-War projects, *Peter Pan* had actually been in the works, in one form or another, for quite a long time. Disney had purchased the film rights to the story all the way back in 1938, but World War II happened, and Disney's animated projects were set back almost a decade. As only the second cinema adaptation of the story (the first was a 1924 silent film which stayed largely faithful to J.M. Barrie's original play), Disney was the first entity to really put its own spin on Peter and Neverland.

**Point by Point**

* We open on the bustling Darling household in London, with Mr. and Mrs. Darling preparing for a night out amidst the chaos of John and Michael playing pirates in the nursery. Mr. Darling, despite being the heavy (or perhaps because of that), is a rich font of comedy. Incidentally, in performances of J.M. Barrie's play, it's considered traditional for the roles of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook to be played by the same actor. I think it's neat that Disney carried that tradition over.
* Peter Pan's entry as a spritely, agile figure on the Darling's shadowy rooftop, to the accompaniment of flute music, is a good one, presenting him as sort of mysterious and enigmatic. This is likely also the first time in *Peter Pan*'s history that Tinker Bell had been portrayed as something more than just a blob of light. Being able to see her facial expressions and read her body language really adds a lot of depth to her character. Barrie's play *tells* us that Tinker Bell is angry and jealous of Wendy, but this movie *shows* us.
* Peter and the children flying through the night sky over London, to the tune of 'You Can Fly!', is one of the best parts of the movie, I think. Tinker Bell deliberately skips through Wendy's reflection in the river. It's adorable watching her be such a pouty little bitch.
* Something odd that I noticed this time. As we meet the pirates for the first time, they're throwing knives idly at a crude drawing on the wall labeled ""The Cap'n"". Thing is, the drawing has *two* hands. Why would the pirates draw The Cap'n with *two* hands?
* Captain Hook is a colorful, flamboyant villain; cowardly, but stylish; a memorable addition to the pantheon of Disney antagonists. His obsession with Peter Pan is made all the clearer by the evident dissatisfaction of his crew; they're sick of hanging around in Neverland and want to go to sea, but Hook is dead set on defeating Pan first.
* Peter Pan really does act like a boy. He's not an adult character disguised as a child, he genuinely is a child. Take his behavior at Mermaid Lagoon, for example. He flies down there by himself and immediately begins bragging to the mermaids about his adventures, leaving Wendy to climb awkwardly down. Then, when the mermaids attack Wendy, he just laughs. He intervenes only when it looks as though Wendy is about to brain one of them with a conch shell. Point is, he's not particularly chivalrous or considerate. He's just a kid.
* This is followed by a pretty good sequence showcasing the seething antagonism between Peter and Hook. With both action and comedy, Peter rescues Tiger Lily and Hook almost ends up as Crocodile food.
* The Indians are unflattering racial caricatures, there's no denying that. They're buffoonish, mostly ugly, wild in every sense of the word, and they're as red as fire engines. But, when all's said and done, they aren't really meant to be accurate depictions of Native Americans. Neverland, as conceived by J.M. Barrie, is a fantasyland for boys, full of things that boys back then were enamored of. To young boys in Barrie's time, Indians weren't disenfranchised victims of colonialism and genocide; they represented adventure and independence and the great outdoors. Mom and Dad got you down? Run away and live with the Indians! I'm not saying that their portrayal in this film is justified; just that there's a certain context to it.
* In the play, Tinker Bell saves Peter's life by drinking poison, then is revived by the heartfelt applause of the audience. But you can't really do that with a movie. So here the glass of poison is replaced with a time bomb, which Tinker Bell carries out of Peter's hands just in time. Tinker Bell is weakened by the explosion, but is able to regain her strength.
* The battle on the pirate ship is quite the exciting finale, especially when Peter and Hook duel up in the rigging. Of course, Peter defeats Hook, after which Hook begs for mercy. Peter grants said mercy, only for Hook to try and literally stab him in the back. This moment of the hero's mercy being thrown back in his face recurs in later Disney features such as *Beauty and the Beast*, *The Lion King*, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, and *Tarzan*. The moral of the story seems clear; never show your enemy mercy.
* In the play, Peter and his friends use the pirate ship to sail the seas back to London. In this movie, Tinker Bell drenches the whole damn ship with pixie dust, and they *fly* it back to London. An extravagant tweaking of the original material, which is Disney's specialty.

**In Conclusion**

Another triumphant adaptation by Disney. It doesn't do anything new on the technical side of things, and the song catalog is a bit weak, but it's full of fun and adventure and colorful characters. For now I'm going to stick it between *Alice in Wonderland* and *Dumbo*.

in the play peter and his friends use the pirate ship to sail the seas back to london in this movie tinker bell drenches the whole damn ship with pixie dust and they fly it back to london an

The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder - Dejanae and Maya's friendship makes no sense to me,"I don't understand how Maya can be friends with Dejanae and be nice to her, but has issues with Penny. Throughout the two seasons, I find it strange that Maya has a dislike for Penny even though Penny really hasn't been that horrible to her. But Maya is willing to be friends with Dejanae, and even be nice to her even though she caused her and her brother a lot of trouble.

Even though Dejanae has done worse to her than Penny. Great example is when Dejanae exposed her family online. Depending on where they lived, that could have ended with Maya and her brother being taken away from her father's and her conferable home because Dejanae wanted likes. In fact, Dejanae treated her like poop (being nice here) after exposing her on her social media page. And Maya is still nicer to her than Penny, who in reality just has minor disagreements with. Penny was respectful of her home life and was open-minded to learn about her and not judge her.

So why does Maya dislike Penny but not Dejanea? Like yes, she thinks she's superficial and everything, but by the end of the day, Penny didn't try to expose your life and put your family in danger. She was open-minded and wanted to understand you rather than judge you. And you pay her back by being a bi\*\*h? By hanging out with Lacienega, who also treated you like crap in that episode, but constantly judging her but not the others who actually hurt you?

Howard - Howard Ashman doc,"I’m so glad this got a reprieve. I watched it today and enjoyed it immensely and learned a lot as well. The last quarter or so is very sad as it covers his illness and the race to complete what he could. I didn’t realize they were bringing work to him in the hospital. I knew he had died before the Oscars when Beauty and the Beast was nominated but I thought he at least made it til the release of the movie.

Loved the recreation of his childhood playtime with his sister, all the 60s and 70s background, and the glimpses of the plays he helped put on. I especially loved all the behind the scenes footage of the creation of Little Mermaid and BATB. The scenes of Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury (RIP x 2) were delightful.

This doc made me want to watch all three of the Disney movies that Ashman had a hand in, as well as the 1986 Little Shop of Horrors movie, which I never have seen.

"Your thoughts on ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1951)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cgpkntvjwg2b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=133a5153a4963a5bafffc82eed7dbfbf30aebae2

**Overview**

Walt Disney had wanted to put an adaptation of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* on the big screen for years, but things kept getting in the way; things like competing adaptations, and bankruptcy, and Hitler. Finally, in 1951, Alice got out the door. Surprising as it seems today, however, *Alice in Wonderland* was met with a mixed reception. Not only did it underperform financially, but many critics took it to task for being too far removed from the spirit of the book. It wouldn't see a theatrical reissue until 1974, well after Walt's death.

**Point by Point**

* The opening credits are nice, resplendent with colorful drawings of the weird characters we're about to meet, with the lilting song 'Alice in Wonderland' playing over them. The film starts out very vibrant and colorful, even in the real world. Then the descent down the extradimensional rabbit hole is replete with interesting visuals.
* I don't have quite as much to say about *Alice in Wonderland*, as it lacks a strong narrative (Alice basically just bumbles from one absurd episode to the next) and doesn't manage anything truly groundbreaking on the technological side. It's a fun time, though, and Alice is likable and sympathetic enough to endear her to us, even if her conflict is pretty two-dimensional.
* I'd say the episode in the garden full of talking flowers is the first really impressive sequence, with bright visuals, sight gags aplenty, and the song 'All in the Golden Afternoon'. This leads directly into Alice's encounter with the Caterpillar, who smokes a hookah and speaks like Peter Sellers playing Inspector Clouseau. His habit of creating midair constructs from smoke allows for plenty of humor.
* The Mad Tea Party is easily one of the best sequences in the entire film; a smorgasbord of jokes and visual gags. It goes all in on the lunacy and really sells it.
* Going from the dark forest to the brightness of the Queen's garden makes for a tonal shift that I found to evoke excitement and suspense, even though I knew full well what was going to happen next. 'Painting the Roses Red' is catchy, followed by the visually striking sequence of the procession of playing cards entering the garden ahead of the Queen. The croquet game is likewise entertaining, although the trial that follows is a bit tedious. (Maybe it's because my first exposure to *Alice in Wonderland* was the heavily edited version broadcast on TV, but I'm ready for the final chase to commence right after the Cheshire Cat flips the Queen onto her head.)
* The climactic chase sequence is frantic and manic, with reappearances by many of the memorable characters we've met on Alice's adventure, culminating with the revelation that this has all been a dream and that Alice is simply asleep. It's a good way of wrapping things up.

**In Conclusion**

*Alice in Wonderland* isn't among the strongest films in the WDAS canon, but it's certainly not among the weakest either. It's fun and colorful, with some interesting characters and some good music. I guess I'd put it just above *Dumbo* for now, but keep in mind that almost all of these movies are good, and do not sit vast distances away from their immediate neighbors in my ranking.

It may be weird of saying this... But I'm really going to miss Fairy Tale Weddings.,"When I heard this was amongst the many shows set to be taken off the service, I had to catch some of the show while I still can after watching that Willow reboot. Honestly, this was something I never thought I would find myself watching a lot of all that much when I first started watching it out of curiosity a few years back. Maybe it was just to have something playing in the background but it was some entertaining stuff, even if the hosts tend to be rather cringy from time to time.

There was just something about seeing the proposals be planned out and performed and see the titular weddings go on after they've been planned out as well. It tends to have that sort of feel good thing going on when seeing all these engaged couples enjoy themselves and embracing one another. And that third episode in the second season really does have a lot more emotion put to it when it comes to the bride and groom's backstories regarding their brothers along with that Flash mob proposal.

I don't know if this was something that can still be watched on Hulu or Freeform or whatever but one thing's for sure is that it'll suck a whole dang lot having this be one to be removed from the service as well.

What were people's thoughts on the Willow reboot series after all these years?,"Between hearing about its cancellation and it being one of many shows that were set to be removed from the service starting tomorrow, I thought it would've been best to try to finish the rest of it before than. Probably should've done so sooner instead of doing it at the last day. 

I stopped watching it when new episodes were still airing for various reasons ranging from having other shows premiere around the same time, to stuff within the show itself like the pacing of the show being a bit too long for my liking, all the romance subplots, some of the characters being more annoying than they should be, and more especially I think the soundtrack used for this.

Now seven and a half episodes in I find the show to be confusing plot wise, a bit too long thanks to some of the subplots in it, some of the characters, including the new female ones being more aggravating at times and meh at others, and the soundtrack is still just plain ridiculously questionable. I mean half of the time, it is befitting to that of the original more and what have you but other times, it's just so baffling as to why they thought it best to use a more modern sounding soundtrack in this. It contrasts so much with the fantasy setting that it just takes me out of the whole thing more each time it plays something not of those times. And people complain about the Super Mario movie doing this; at least that handled them better. 

Not to mention being more tonally consistent; this just tries too hard being funny when it can't seem to have a knack of having a balance between being more funny and more serious when it's needed.

Now I approach the high and final episode I feel like some things are done well, especially visually, audits certainly nice seeing some old favorites return here, especial Warrick Davis. But honestly... I'm more conflicted with this. It's sucks that itgot cancelled and will be removed from the service but overall... I'm just more mixed about this show overall.

"Your thoughts on ""Cinderella"" (1950)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4df0orr4a22b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e26172123ac1a7805d9dedab518c8195a4f375e

 **Overview**

Ah, what a breath of fresh air! Hitler is dead and Disney has a bit of money back in the bank, so it's time to return to the full-length masterpieces we all know and love. And *Cinderella*, with its iconic characters, music, and imagery, is the perfect way to start off this new era! Though the archetypal Cinderella story is thousands of years old, this film takes its inspiration mainly from Charles Perrault, whose 1697 rendition of the tale originated many of the things we associate with Cinderella today, including the pumpkin coach, the glass slippers, the fairy godmother, and even the name Cinderella.

**Point by Point**

* The credits sequence, though a simple listing of the talent, is beautiful and dignified, and is accompanied by the lilting song 'Cinderella'. Then, of course, the traditional storybook intro. Gosh, it's good to be back.
* Cinderella is an exquisite reincarnation of Snow White, embodying the same sympathy and grace, and with the same rapport with animals (particularly the chateau's many mice, whom she names and dresses herself). Like Snow White, it's easy to feel protective of her right away. Immediately we get a sense of how busy she is, slaving away for her contemptuous step-family.
* The stepmother (whose name is given as Lady Tremaine) is just an old lady, whose domain begins and ends with this meager household, and yet she's as intimidating and as despicable as any other Disney villain. Props to the animators, writers, and voice actress for elevating this comparatively minor antagonist to the heights of Maleficent, Ursula, and Jafar.
* A lot can be said about Cinderella's stepmother, but she must truly, genuinely love her biological daughters. Only a mother's love would be blind to how homely, graceless, and talentless the stepsisters are, let alone believe for a moment that either one of them is capable of charming a prince. It is said in the introduction that Lady Tremaine is jealous and resentful of Cinderella because of how bad the beautiful and graceful girl makes her own daughters look by comparison, and this contrast is really pushed in our face during the music lesson. Anastasia and Drizella are hopeless at carrying a tune, while Cinderella - scrubbing the floor downstairs - performs it for herself perfectly.
* It's fun watching the mice and the bluebirds assemble a dress for Cinderella to wear to the ball, and it's heartrending watching the spiteful stepsisters tear it to pieces. Everything feels like it's going to be all right when the Fairy Godmother shows up, of course. The 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' sequence is a joyful pick-me-up after the tremendous downer we just witnessed, and watching the Fairy Godmother transform the pumpkin and the animals and, at last, Cinderella's dress, is a highlight of the film.
* The brief romantic sequence between Cinderella and the Prince, dancing at the ball to the tune of 'So This Is Love', is nice, and Cinderella's rush to escape at the stroke of midnight is exciting and suspenseful.
* Another sequence of suspense comes when Lady Tremaine - suddenly suspicious of Cinderella - locks her in her tower bedroom while the Grand Duke is visiting to try the glass slipper on the two stepsisters. Though it's an ordeal, Cinderella's animal friends manage to free her just in time for her to run downstairs and meet the Duke. The stepmother, of course, is so petty and vindictive that she actually trips the Duke's servant carrying the glass slipper, resulting in its destruction. What a swell of triumph, then, when Cinderella reveals to the weeping Duke and the astonished stepmother that the other slipper is right there in her possession.

**In Conclusion**

As with Disney's prior storybook adaptations, *Cinderella* is a triumph of the art form, full of fun and emotion, visually and musically pleasing, and a classic that endures to this day. An excellent return to form.

Disney+ could be the hub of all things Disney instead of a stack of old DVD's,"Quality of content aside, Disney has a ton of new movies and TV shows coming to the service.  I remember the days when a new Pixar film would be a massive event.  A new Indiana Jones movie is coming out and yet I barely knew it was releasing in cinemas.  Disney is supposed to be adding Indy to the service, but it seems in general shows just poop out on to the service with a whimper.

Yet if you go to Youtube there is weekly shows, red carpet events and all sorts of buzz (good and bad) about Disney's projects.  Who is the customer that is going to see these Disney films in cinema?  It's the Disney+ subscribers!  Why isn't there any hype at all on the app?

While we are on the subject it is an app, a online thing that can adapt and change, and yet since launch it looks largely the same.  Why can't the app speak to the Disney Store Online for merch, why can't the app let you buy Cinema tickets through it?  Imagine after the Indy tab is launched and you see all the exciting stuff for the new film and it allows you buy a family ticket right there.  And maybe you get a themed popcorn bucket or something as well.

While I am buying tickets why not get an Indiana Jones t-shirt off the Disney Store right from the app? It arrives in the post in time for me don it at the cinema.

Imagine if your Disney classic film collection tiles could be DVD boxes instead?  How cool would it be to browse through your collection of films like a digital DVD shelf.  

I live in the UK and Disney has a theme park and cruise ships.  Why aren't those promoted more?  Who doesn't love those discovery channel style documentaries of the cruise ships.  How about booking your next holiday through the Disney+ App?  Why not have more live content from the parks.

When Disney was experimenting with Disney+ in the UK it was called Disney Life.  It including music you could listen to, Radio Disney, it included a 10% discount in the Disney Store.  They had classic audio books for kids.  Disney Life was more then just a stack of DVD's.  It was a whole of Disney experience. 

Anyway Disney+ could do a lot through presentation and cross-promotion in the app making you want to check it everyday for what is new and exciting.  

Now the front page is a mix of Peter Pan from a film I never heard of nor care about and some 18 rated show and some dramas I could care less about. 

Basically there is no magic.  They need to add visual magic into the app to excite customers and make a one stop shop for all things Disney.",15,0.86,7,Nintendad47,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1684853251.0,False,False,False,2023-05-23 14:47:31,quality of content aside disney has a ton of new movies and tv shows coming to the service i remember the days when a new pixar film would be a massive event a new indiana jones movie is coming out and yet i barely knew it was releasing in cinemas disney is supposed to be adding indy to the service but it seems in general shows just poop out on to the service with a whimper yet if you go to youtube there is weekly shows red carpet events and all sorts of buzz good and bad about disneys projects who is the customer that is going to see these disney films in cinema its the disney subscribers why isnt there any hype at all on the app while we are on the subject it is an app a online thing that can adapt and change and yet since launch it looks largely the same why cant the app speak to the disney store online for merch why cant the app let you buy cinema tickets through it imagine after the indy tab is launched and you see all the exciting stuff for the new film and it allows you buy a family ticket right there and maybe you get a themed popcorn bucket or something as well while i am buying tickets why not get an indiana jones tshirt off the disney store right from the app it arrives in the post in time for me don it at the cinema imagine if your disney classic film collection tiles could be dvd boxes instead how cool would it be to browse through your collection of films like a digital dvd shelf i live in the uk and disney has a theme park and cruise ships why arent those promoted more who doesnt love those discovery channel style documentaries of the cruise ships how about booking your next holiday through the disney app why not have more live content from the parks when disney was experimenting with disney in the uk it was called disney life it including music you could listen to radio disney it included a discount in the disney store they had classic audio books for kids disney life was more then just a stack of dvds it was a whole of disney experience anyway disney could do a lot through presentation and crosspromotion in the app making you want to check it everyday for what is new and exciting now the front page is a mix of peter pan from a film i never heard of nor care about and some rated show and some dramas i could care less about basically there is no magic they need to add visual magic into the app to excite customers and make a one stop shop for all things disney,disney could be the hub of all things disney instead of a stack of old dvds,1

"Your thoughts on ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" (1949)","&#x200B;

 **Overview**

The final package film of the 1940s, and you know I haven't been a fan of these so far, but *The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad* is actually quite good, with two segments that honor Disney's creative legacy and show signs of them getting back on track. Split into *The Wind in the Willows* (narrated by Basil Rathbone) and *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow* (narrated by Bing Crosby), the film is whimsical and well-made, with greater depth and artistry than we've seen in some time.

**Point by Point**

* Straight off the bat, the visuals are better than your standard *Silly Symphony* or Donald Duck cartoon. The action in some of the prior anthologies seems slapdash and low-grade, but the sequence with Toad rampaging through the English countryside with his horse and cart is buttery smooth, and the same can be said of the later set pieces that take place during Toad's escape from prison and the attack on the weasel-infested Toad Hall. Really, the difference in quality of animation between this and something like *Make Mine Music* is like night and day.
* Where *The Wind in the Willows* is fully voice acted, *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow* is done in pantomime, with more songs. I admit I have nostalgia for this one, as it was traditional viewing in my household every Halloween night when I was a kid. Even without rose-colored glasses, however, I think the rounded characters, thoughtful writing, quality animation, and catchy music still set it above most other short features Disney had turned out at this point.
* As with *The Wind in the Willows*, the characters of *Sleepy Hollow* are more fleshed out than the comparative stick figures populating the segments of prior anthologies. Ichabod Crane is at once snobbish, superstitious, a lover of good food, and inexplicably attractive to women, although he's principally concerned with what he can get from them. Even after falling in love with the wealthy Katrina van Tassel, he's equally as infatuated with her family fortune.
* Katrina gives Ichabod the time of day, but it's clear she's just using him as a foil for Brom Bones (a sort of forebear of *Beauty and the Beast*'s Gaston). She wants to flirt around and play coy, but Ichabod is the only man in the village who isn't intimidated into submission by Brom. The sequence in which we see Ichabod consistently defeat Brom (mostly by accident) as he courts Katrina is good comedy.
* The dance sequence with the overly eager woman at van Tassel's Halloween party is a good bit of raucous comedy amidst the lower-key proceedings. The song 'The Headless Horseman', performed afterwards, is one of the highlights of the feature.
* The sequence of Ichabod riding home through the dark forest, with nothing but the Headless Horseman on his mind, is appropriately bleak and foreboding, and the tension picks up as every sound around him conspires to terrorize him further. Finally, when the tension breaks, and Ichabod realizes he's jumping at shadows, and he begins to laugh madly at what a fool he's been, it really does seem like that's that. See what happens when you let your imagination run away with you, kiddies? There's no such thing as ghosts. Don't be a nervous fool like our friend Ichabod.
* Oh, wait, ghosts are real! Yes, seemingly out of nowhere, the Headless Horseman materializes and a thrilling chase ensues. In the end, Ichabod's fate is left ambiguous. He did get across that bridge, after all, even if he did take a flaming pumpkin to the head. Maybe he woke up in the mud a few minutes later and decided to leave right away for parts unknown, or...maybe the Headless Horseman got him after all.

**In Conclusion**

There's no denying it's been a rough decade for Disney features, what with Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi being supplanted by the likes of Bongo, Pecos Bill, and anthropomorphic mail planes and tugboats. The two segments contained within *The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad* are undeniably good, however, and remain classics to this day in their own right. At least we're capping this era on a high note. And now that Disney finally has the time and resources to get back to reinventing the wheel with animated fairy tale epics, what's next on the docket? *Cinderella*, of course!

"My Dr. Doom, Disney+ Series....thoughts? Input? Suggestions? (Fan-made / Fan-fiction)","  

Please bare with me…this is a long read

Intro:

So, I am finalizing a series of scripts that is a story about my favorite Marvel character of all time...Victor Von Doom! I'm doing this as practice to refine my script-writing skills. I would LOVE for this to be a reality, however. I know that's a long shot. I'm posting an overall synopsis here, just to gather thoughts and feedback.

Background on how my version of DOOM fits in the MCU:

After the Infinity Gauntlet phases, I felt the need to go in another direction for MCU. With Thanos, Marvel gradually teased him throughout the phase which culminated with Thanos’ story being fully fleshed out in the last 2 Avengers movies. With my version of Doom, I thought it would be best if Marvel / Disney introduced him first through a Disney+ series. This series would explore Doom’s motivations, backstory and skills so that we could later see his handiwork in all future movies and shows. It could be in post-credits scenes or sprinkled within the future shows and movies which would culminate with an epic showdown with. Doom himself.

THE RISE OF DOOM (series title)

The story would begin with Victor as a child. Victor is an olive skinned Roma (Gypsy) and an extremely bright young man with a natural gifts for strategy and robotics. He is self-taught and boast an extreme ego, even as a child.

As the series opens, we see a young Victor walking through the streets of Latveria. The area he lives is within the slums and Victor himself is dressed in ragged attire. For fun, Victor plays chess with elderly citizens and also performs magic to impress the local girls. The magic he performs is not slight of hand, but actual magic, which he learned from his mother.

When Victor arrives home we meet two other crucial characters, his mother and his “pet”. His “pet” is a crudely designed yet sophisticated robot, which Victor himself created. It is a masterpiece of robotic technology fueled by magical source, which he had harnessed in a crude fashion. The robot is also a source of comedic relief within the series.

At home, we see Victor’s close relationship with his single mother. She teaches him traditions, magic and kindness yet they struggle with the current political climate within Latveria. There is much unrest in the country, due to rising racism against the Roma (Gypsy) people. This is all subtle for the time being.

Fast forward to Victor now being a college age young man. He is extremely attractive and very flirtatious with the local girls, yet too engrossed in his quest for knowledge and robotics to become involved with any of them. He gets home to discover his mother happy and excited with news to share. Victor. Has been accepted to MIT, full scholarship in robotics! Victor is ecstatic, yet hesitant to leave his mother due to rising tensions against the Roma people within Latveria. His mother reassures him that everything will be alright and lovingly supports him to chase his dreams of attending college in the United States. Victor eventually agrees.

COLLEGE:

Victor leaves Latveria and travels to the United States. He is almost an immediate celebrity in college due to his good looks, self-confidence, brilliant mind and exotic accent. In college he meets another brilliant student named Reed Richards. As Victor is extremely competitive, he instantly views Reed as his “competition” and strives to out-do him in every facet.

Contrary to Victor, Reed is extremely kind-hearted and tries to befriend Victor. Victor is much to egocentric and competitive to accept this. While Victor’s specialty is in robotics, Reed’s expertise is in physics and biology. Victor pushes to better himself in an attempt to remain competitive with Reed. In fact, his need to outshine Richards takes priority over almost all else. As Victor’s college life continues, he begins to get increasingly stressed. News reports from Latveria is reporting that an eccentric leader, named Tiger Wylde, has taken political control of the country and has begun to create an apartheid state against the Roma people.

As tensions continue, Victor becomes increasingly stressed and his performance suffers. Reed attempts to help and befriend him, yet Victor’s ego will not allow it. The final straw comes as news from Latveria reports that Tiger Wylde has begun rounding up the Roma people. At this same time, Victor is teamed up with Reed for an important mid-term chemistry project. During the project, Victor is not himself and is making many uncharacteristic mistakes. Reed tries to warn him, but Victor will not listen. Torn by his personal conflicts, worry about his mother and his unnecessary competitive attitude towards Reed, Victor makes a mistake causing an explosion that gives him a cut on his cheek.

Victor is enraged and blames the situation entirely on Reed. Since he can no longer contact his mother, Victor drops out of college and returns to Latveria. When he arrives, he finds out his mother has been taken by the state. Victor further improves his “pet” robot and makes it an intense machine, a mixture of robotics and magic. He also builds a magical infused robotic mask to hide his face. This covers his scar (which is not that bad, but his vanity causes him to see it as terrible) and allows him to remain anonymous as he strategizes how to save his mother. During the creation process, the mask had not finished properly cooling and Victor puts in on. The hot metal sears his flesh and the mask is permanently grafted to his skin. Victor finds local residents who are not happy with the apartheid state their nation has become.

Victor attempts to rescue his mother, but by the time he reaches her she is already dead. This causes him to snap. He is no longer Victor after this moment, he has become DOOM! He joins a local resistance movement and begins to help them strategize a revolution. He uses his skill in robotics and magic, and creates the first, crudely built, Doombots to help in the insurrection.

At first, Victor and his forces are defeated badly by Tiger Wylde and his forces. Victor befriends several of his fellow revolutionaries and manages to escape. Once escaped, he focuses and begins to perfect his Doombots, creating a formidable army.

The combined forces of Doom, Victor and the patriotic citizens manages to overthrow the government and kill Dictator Wylde in an epic showdown.

Once defeated, we see Doom assume the throne of Latveria. He mercilessly kills the apartheid supporters and begins to instantly create a better life for the people of Latveria. He is beloved by all the citizens. Now, as the leader of a nation on the world stage, Doom sits in his iconic throne and begins to strategize his next objective…..the world!

BONUS EPISODE: (based on Amazing Spiderman #350)

After the series has officially ended, an unexpected bonus episode is released. In this episode, we are taken to New York where a friendly neighborhood Spiderman is swinging around. Spiderman hears alarms sounding in the distance which are coming from the New York museum. As he investigates, he discovers Doom in the museum. He is stealing an artifact, that we see earlier in the series, which belonged to his mother. It is a magical artifact that was stolen from his mother and smuggled out of the country during the apartheid and rounding up of the Roma people.

Spiderman attempts to stop Doom, but is easily outmatched (see the comic reference). Doom easily defeats our friendly neighborhood Spiderman, and leaves with the relic. This episode introduces Doom to the larger Marvel universe while showcasing his power. As the episode concludes, a badly battered Spiderman is reporting this new threat to Earth’s heroes, while Doom begins to interact with the relic. The relic itself, is much more powerful and important than anyone realizes!

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

As a lifelong comic book fan, and Dr. Doom superfan, much of the imagery in my mind is scenes directly from the comic. Iconic imagery which pays homage to Marvel’s past artists and comic book fans alike.

Binge Watching Content Being Removed,"I subscribed to Disney Plus right before it launched and originally had the three year deal. I've always really enjoyed the service and still do but definitely disappointed by the removal of shows, but understand the move from a business perspective. 

I've had a busy year and spent more of my free time on games and getting of the house. I didn't have time to watch some series and movies I wanted to get around to, with some free time this weekend and working from home I'm trying to marathon and binge watch a lot of the content I missed and was wondering if anyone else was before they remove it? 

Like I just watched all of Willow and I actually really enjoyed it. The second half kind of really removes itself from the original movie, but I don't think anywhere bad as it was made out to be. It was fun, silly, campy, and ridiculous. Loved the CGI and practical effects and it's too bad it'll be left on a cliffhanger. I didn't watch the original movie until I was an adult so there wasn't nostalgia there so I can see why people would feel like it abandoned what they love, but as a story se in the same universe I thought it was great especially Warwick Davis. 

Now in the middle of season 2 of The Mysterious Benedict Society. Absolutely adored the first season and how much detail went into it. I just love how quirky the whole thing is. I love the the color palette, the way it is filmed almost has a Wes Anderson or Pushing Daisies vibe to it, Tony Hale and Kristen Schaal are amazing and all of the kids are really great. I think losing this one is definitely a big loss and hope it finds a home or becomes a bit of a cult classic.

Plan is to get through Big Shot Season 2, Mighty Ducks Season 2, and the Quest and hoping to catch some of the movies and short documentaries like M Power or Voices Rising before they all go off. Probably won't have the time to finish everything but it's fun rediscovering a lot of these originals before they are gone, reminds me of that first month of the service back in 2019.",42,0.85,32,lampfiles,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1684676769.0,False,False,False,2023-05-21 13:46:09,i subscribed to disney plus right before it launched and originally had the three year deal ive always really enjoyed the service and still do but definitely disappointed by the removal of shows but understand the move from a business perspective ive had a busy year and spent more of my free time on games and getting of the house i didnt have time to watch some series and movies i wanted to get around to with some free time this weekend and working from home im trying to marathon and binge watch a lot of the content i missed and was wondering if anyone else was before they remove it like i just watched all of willow and i actually really enjoyed it the second half kind of really removes itself from the original movie but i dont think anywhere bad as it was made out to be it was fun silly campy and ridiculous loved the cgi and practical effects and its too bad itll be left on a cliffhanger i didnt watch the original movie until i was an adult so there wasnt nostalgia there so i can see why people would feel like it abandoned what they love but as a story se in the same universe i thought it was great especially warwick davis now in the middle of season of the mysterious benedict society absolutely adored the first season and how much detail went into it i just love how quirky the whole thing is i love the the color palette the way it is filmed almost has a wes anderson or pushing daisies vibe to it tony hale and kristen schaal are amazing and all of the kids are really great i think losing this one is definitely a big loss and hope it finds a home or becomes a bit of a cult classic plan is to get through big shot season mighty ducks season and the quest and hoping to catch some of the movies and short documentaries like m power or voices rising before they all go off probably wont have the time to finish everything but its fun rediscovering a lot of these originals before they are gone reminds me of that first month of the service back in,binge watching content being removed,1
"Your thoughts on ""Melody Time"" (1948)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v1hi8lgo881b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8c0c6db3336f0d117dc930e123aca84f12d213a

**Overview**

*Melody Time* follows in the same vein as *Make Mine Music*, presenting a series of short, unrelated cartoons, each set to a piece of music or a ballad. Overall, it's a cut above *Make Mine Music* and the other anthology films we've seen so far. The material is more diverse and more interesting, and the production values at least appear higher. Still, I just want to get back to beautiful, groundbreaking features like *Snow White* and *Bambi*.

**Point by Point**

* The opening feature, *Once Upon a Wintertime*, is nice enough. An inoffensive, fluffy piece with some cute characters. *Bumble Boogie*, set to a swing-jazz variation of 'Flight of the Bumblebee', actually seems like it could have been slotted easily into *Fantasia*.
* *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* is one of the highlights of the film. Good music, good story. Part of the appeal for me might be nostalgia, as we had this short taped off *The Wonderful World of Disney* when I was a kid.
* *Little Toot*, about an anthropomorphic tugboat who can't seem to stay out of trouble, isn't very strong. It's fine, I guess. *Trees* is a short segment based on the poem ""Trees"" by Joyce Kilmer. The visuals are quite nice, and have a real *Fantasia* feel to them. *Blame It on the Samba*, starring Donald Duck and Jose Carioca, is insubstantial, but good for a chuckle.
* Finally we have *Pecos Bill*, the longest segment at twenty-two minutes. Like *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed*, it's a colorful and entertaining ""tall tale"", narrated by none other than Roy Rogers. It portrays Pecos as basically a god of Texan mythology, responsible for such feats as carving the Rio Grande and painting the Painted Desert.

**In Conclusion**

As noted above, *Melody Time* is probably the best in its family of features. Though it's still just a mediocrity in the Disney canon, I'd rank it above *Make Mine Music*, *Fun and Fancy Free*, *The Three Caballeros*, and *Saludos Amigos*.

 **Overview**

We're still in the reeds of Disney's anthology features, but *Fun and Fancy Free* is a cut above those we've seen previously. It's divided into two stories that were originally conceived as feature films to stand on their own; *Bongo* and *Mickey and the Beanstalk*. Interestingly, this project marked the last time Walt Disney performed the voice of Mickey Mouse.

**Point by Point**

* None other than *Pinocchio*'s Jiminy Cricket starts us off, singing a little song about how happy and carefree he is. Easy for you to say, Jiminy, you didn't spend the last fifteen years suffering through the Great Depression and then World War II. Anyway, he introduces us to the story of *Bongo*, as performed by Dinah Shore. *Bongo* is an adequate feature about a multitalented circus bear who escapes to live in the woods, meets a little girl bear, and fights a much larger bear for the right to her hand (or paw). It's not tremendously interesting, and, in particular, the love song 'Too Good to Be True' goes on for too long.
* *Mickey and the Beanstalk* (narrated by famed ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, with his dummies Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd) definitely makes up the stronger side of *Fun and Fancy Free*. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy play impoverished farmers on the brink of starvation, who end up exchanging their cow for magic beans. The sequence of the beanstalk growing up overnight, high up into the clouds, taking the house with it, is a good one.
* Mickey and friends don't have the time for a thorough exploration of this strange new land above the clouds, but what we do see - a scuffle with a giant dragonfly, and a table laid out with all sorts of giant food - carries a sense of whimsy. Not whimsy on the level of *Pinocchio* or *Bambi*, but whimsy nonetheless. The giant, though buffoonish, is malevolent enough to evoke a sense of danger and suspense as he first traps Mickey and friends, then chases after them when they escape.

**In Conclusion**

*Fun and Fancy Free* is overall mediocre, but it's a good step above the likes of *The Three Caballeros* and *Make Mine Music*. Though there's nothing special about either of the features presented, I do get the sense that they were crafted with a little more artistry and care.

 **Overview**

One of several anthology features Disney produced during the 1940s in order to offset the troubles presented by World War II, *Make Mine Music* is a loose collection of short animated features set to various types of music, with performances by Doris Day, Benny Goodman, the Andrews Sisters, and other popular artists of the day. It was never reissued in theaters after its initial release, nor did it receive a proper home video release until 2000, but its many segments saw exposure to Disney fans over the decades, paired up with longer features or broadcast on TV.

**Point by Point**

* Honestly, there isn't much to say about this one. Each segment is very run-of-the-mill, without any particular innovation or prestige. *The Martins and the Coys* (inspired by the real-life feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys) is amusing enough as an opening number, but largely insipid. *All the Cats Join In* \- a sequence depicting hip teens dancing to swing music at the malt shoppe - is okay too. *Casey at the Bat* is probably the most compelling of them all, but still nothing special.
* *Peter and the Wolf*, *Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet*, and *The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met* are each pretty tedious. Others, such as *Blue Bayou* and *Two Silhouettes*, are so insubstantial as to not be worth mentioning.

**In Conclusion**

After enduring *Saludos Amigos* and *The Three Caballeros* before this, I'm really getting tired of these decidedly mediocre anthologies that did nothing to stretch Disney's creative muscle. Unfortunately, circumstances were what they were; their budget was tight, the foreign markets were closed off, and their people were fighting in the War. It is true that projects such as these helped Disney save up money for later triumphs such as *Cinderella*, *Peter Pan*, and *Alice in Wonderland*, so I suppose there's that.

 **Overview**

A companion to *Saludos Amigos*, *The Three Caballeros* continues Disney's endorsement of Latin American culture, and also celebrates Donald Duck's tenth anniversary (he debuted in 1934). The narrative framing device sees Donald receiving presents from and celebrating with his Latin American friends, Jose Carioca (returning from *Saludos Amigos*) and Panchito Pistoles (a new character).

**Point by Point**

* We open with a short cartoon about a penguin (oddly enough) named Pablo, who dislikes the cold and wishes to trade the South Pole for South America. This is followed by a fact-based animated segment about various birds native to South America, which is a bit dry.
* After a cartoon about a flying donkey from Uruguay, Jose shows up and takes Donald on a tour of the Brazilian state of Bahia. The song 'Have You Been to Bahia?' is a pretty one. The segment blends animation with live-action, and we see Donald and Jose interacting with human performers. I'd say the sequence runs a little long, however.
* Donald opens his gift from Mexico and Panchito pops out, pistols firing. This is where the title song 'The Three Caballeros' is performed. It's a lively, catchy number, and is undoubtedly the highlight of the film.
* Next we learn about Mexico, and the boys take another live-action tour, hitting key locations like Mexico City and Acapulco. Like the one in Bahia, this sequence is kind of interminable. There's *a lot* of Donald becoming infatuated with live-action women and chasing after them, and the whole thing eventually collapses into some sort of fever dream. It abruptly ends with Donald and friends reenacting a bullfight, and some fireworks.

**In Conclusion**

*The Three Caballeros* is superior to *Saludos Amigos* due to its increased substance, but, like that other film, it has nothing to really recommend itself. Its only real value is as a curio, and, unless you're a WDAS completist, you can safely skip over this one.

Muppets Mayhem brings to light the mayhem that is... The Electric Mayhem. 

I love Animal and I love Janice ""fer sher"" but I didn't know much about Floyd, Lips and Zoot but I love the whole band after this show

Lips is probably one of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I have NO clue what he says half the time but he's so funny! 

The humans on the show are somewhat okay, I love Nora and Moog and all the celeb cameos. Didn't care for her sister and the blonde guy (can tell cause I don't know their names 🤣) 

The songs mostly slap, and it's just a good time all around. Even teared up at their final song (no spoilers dw)

 **Overview**

After *Bambi*, and largely because of World War II, Disney's next several animated features were anthologies, rather than single, longer narratives. The first of these was *Saludos Amigos*, commissioned by the U.S. Department of State as part of Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy with regards to Latin America. At just forty-two minutes long, it is by far the shortest feature in the WDAS canon.

**Point by Point**

* *Saludos Amigos* (which is Spanish for ""Greetings, Friends"") is a collection of four short cartoons, framed by brief, intermittent, live-action blurbs of unnamed Disney artists exploring Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru, and taking in the local color. The first cartoon features Donald Duck exploring the Lake Titicaca area, to predictably slapstick results.
* Next up is a cartoon called *Pedro*, about an anthropomorphic little mail plane who is tasked with flying over the mighty Andes to deliver the mail from Argentina to Chile. He runs into a violent storm high above the mountain range, but he pulls through all right.
* We're served a bit of education on Buenos Aires and the fertile Argentinian plains called the Pampas. Then our third cartoon, *El Gaucho Goofy*, sees Texan cowboy Goofy transplanted to Argentina to learn about the similar lifestyle of a *gaucho* (basically the Latin American cowboy).
* *Aquarela do Brasil* (""Watercolor of Brazil"") is the fourth and final cartoon, with an unseen artist painting alluring scenery onscreen (kind of like that famous *Looney Tunes* short where Elmer Fudd uses a paintbrush to mess with Bugs Bunny), to the tune of Ary Barroso's 'Aquarela do Brasil'. Written in 1939, the song became internationally famous after being featured in *Saludos Amigos*. Also featured in this short is new character Jose Carioca (later of *The Three Caballeros*) teaching Donald Duck about the samba.

**In Conclusion**

*Saludos Amigos* is pleasant enough, but it has nothing exceptional to recommend it. It's simply nothing more than four standard cartoons, framed by a little bit of very broad, very basic trivia on Latin American culture. There's really no reason to watch it at all unless you're a WDAS completist. I guess audiences were happy with it back then, but, after what we've seen so far, it's disappointingly mediocre.

Is Disneyplus removing its Originals to other streaming services?,"https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/lifestyle/disney-remove-streaming-content-follows-181340112.html

https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/disney-will-start-removing-content-streaming-platforms-1234861274/

I really hope Disney doesn’t license out their big titles from Marvel and Star Wars, especially their Original shows. It’s one of the things that I like about D+ and distinguishes it from the other services, where I can binge all the: Iron Man movies, Thor, Captain America, etc. in timeline order, release order, or whatever Marvel show or movie I feel like watching, well you get the gist. I like and appreciate that I can watch all of them without having to search up where to watch the next movie/show in the timeline and pay again to watch that. 

I feel like Disney losing 4 Million subs gave them a big scare and now instead of creating more original content, they’re doing the opposite, which might very well lose them even more subscribers if the lack of content and price hikes aren’t already.

 **Overview**

Walt Disney had been trying for years to get *Bambi* off the ground and onto the screen, but budget concerns and technical problems put the project continuously on hold. It was worth the wait, however, as *Bambi* would become an enduring classic, widely regarded as one of Disney's best. (On a personal note, the 1988 reissue of *Bambi* was the first movie I ever saw in a theater. I was four.)

**Point by Point**

* *Bambi* opens with possibly the most beautiful titles sequence yet, with elegant cursive set against forest silhouettes, and the lilting 'Love Is a Song' playing. It really sets the tone for what feels like something special.
* The visuals impress right away. The forest scenery is beautiful, and the animals, while still cartoonish, are much more detailed and more realistic than those seen in prior features. Bambi is adorable, and it's a joy to watch him run and jump around and discover things.
* In the tradition of Jiminy Cricket and Timothy Mouse, Thumper serves as an able sidekick for Bambi, introducing comedy and a dash of mischief to the proceedings, providing a foil for the main character and a proxy for the audience.
* The brief 'Little April Shower' sequence is nice, with good water effects, and a bevy of birds and animals heading for cover. This gives way quickly to a cymbal-clashing thunderstorm, teaching Bambi the lesson that nature is not always quiet and gentle.
* Bambi's first visit to the meadow embodies many of the movie's different moods. We get to see a variety of different animals (including Thumper and his family) playing around. We get to see Bambi meet and frolic with the boisterous Faline. We witness a parade of powerful stags. And we have our first encounter with Man; a dread, unseen force whose menace looms large over the proceedings. (And the three-note theme that plays when Man is near used to scare me.)
* Summer turns to fall, and fall to winter, and, before the tragedy that we all know is coming, we get to enjoy Bambi and Thumper's ice skating scene as a bit of innocent slapstick.
* With the world blanketed in thick snow, food is scarce, and the deer resort to stripping the bark off trees to eat. After an indeterminate period of lean grazing, Bambi and his mother find a patch of fresh spring grass to enjoy. Of course, this is where Man comes in for the second time, and, sadly, after a tense chase, Bambi's mother is no more. As Bambi searches and calls out for her, and the snow falls thick and blinding, Bambi's father appears and tells him, ""Your mother can't be with you anymore."" The end of childhood; the end of innocence.
* Act II. Spring has arrived, love is in the air, and Bambi has a new set of antlers. It's cute watching Thumper and Flower meet their mates and get ""twitterpated"". Faline reappears, and Bambi falls too. In case you thought it was going to be all sweetness and light, however, a dark rival for Faline's affections presents himself, and a fierce battle ensues. This, too, is part of nature; part of life. The duel is brutal, with striking visuals, and, of course, Bambi emerges triumphant in the end. A joyous courtship under moonlight follows.
* And then, apocalypse. A large hunting party has come to the forest, and we witness a mass exodus of birds and animals as they retreat deeper into the woods, bursts of buckshot dogging their steps. Faline looks frantically for Bambi and is set upon by a pack of dogs. Impressively, Bambi manages to fight them off, but is wounded midflight by a hunter's bullet.
* And if this still wasn't enough excitement for you, now comes the fire, and the thrilling sequence during which Bambi and his father escape the all-consuming blaze by leaping from atop a waterfall. Then the relief as we see them both - along with many other animals - emerge safely on the other side.
* In the finale, we see Thumper and Flower and Bambi have all had offspring of their own. We feel happy, nostalgic, maybe even a little bit sad. The circle of life continues.

**In Conclusion**

Just about everything that you'd want from a Disney movie is here. An emotional roller coaster, luscious visuals, excellent music, all wrapped up in a seventy-minute story about cute, talking animals. I think *Pinocchio* still edges it out, but it's clear where *Bambi* gets its deserved reputation.

RANT: Almost a year later - still no localization options available for Bulgaria/Croatia/Serbia/Slovenia!!!!,"We're closing in on a FULL YEAR (that would be June 14th) since the service launched in the countries mentioned above (among many others) and there is still ZERO titles with subtitles or dubs available in Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian.

I was visiting my folks in Bulgaria recently and was curious how far the service had come in those regions since launch. The library is great, among the best in the entire world, but the lack of proper localization means that I still cannot share this wonderful service with my parents, and trust me - they love Disney and they also love their procedurals like Criminal Minds.

Now, mind you, the local Disney Channel has been fully localized for more than 14 years with dubs available for every single TV show/film/programme that has ever been broadcast on it. On the other hand, 14 years later, the local Disney Channel is still broadcast in SD at a mere 576i....

The theatrical animated films from Walt Disney Studios, Pixar and 20th Century Studios have (for more than 2 decades) always been fully dubbed/subbed and those dubs/subs are, strangely, available for rent or to buy on Apple TV. Huh?

So, all in all, a lot of the content is already there. Yes, some technical hurdles would have to be overcome and the company would have to pay to someone to clean some of the files up, but it all comes with the territory.

This sort of negligence towards the people in those countries is absolutely inexcusable and shows that the company truly doesn't care.

Last but not least - it's not about the size or the population of the countries. There's plenty of countries smaller in size and/or population than the ones I mentioned above, some even in he same region, that have had subs and dubs delivered to them in a timely manner. The truth is that someone along the line, who is responsible for the development of the service in the region, dropped the ball and there's no one to pick it up.

Trust me, plenty of people are willing to subscribe (and many younger people already have).

"Your thoughts on ""Dumbo"" (1941)","&#x200B;

 **Overview**

Deliberately simpler and lower budget than *Pinocchio* and *Fantasia*, in order to recoup the financial losses of those two prior films, *Dumbo* is one of Disney's shortest animated features, but also one of its most charming. It's the first to focus primarily on animal characters, and the charm and whimsy with which it does so bodes well for the many, many such features in Disney's future.

**Point by Point**

* The opening credits on what appear to be colorful, circus-themed postcards, set against bombastic, celebratory music, set the tone right away, getting the viewer keyed up for something exciting. It's a bit different than 'When You Wish Upon a Star'.
* The sequence with the storks delivering the cute baby animals to their mothers at the circus is a good way to start off. It made me smile.
* Mrs. Jumbo's love for Dumbo is immediate and unconditional. She isn't bothered by his big ears at all. While the other elephants are voicing their alarm, she doesn't bat an eye. In fact, she uses his ears to swaddle him.
* Another good sequence comes as the circus laborers and the elephants cooperate to hoist the big top against a driving thunderstorm. (Yes, the laborers are all black men who sing a song about being illiterate and irresponsible with money. It is what it is. I'm blowing past it.)
* Dumbo being given a bath and playing with his mother is a cute and joyful sequence; possibly the best moment in the movie. Of course, it all comes to an end when the two are forcibly separated, after Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper defending Dumbo from an abusive child. The circus workers are lucky that none of them are killed, frankly. Mrs. Jumbo is huge, and strong, and her eyes go red with fury as she flings her little antagonists through the air. In that moment she would have trampled them all to get to Dumbo and would have thought nothing of it.
* The other elephants are awful, still running Dumbo down while he's sitting alone and crying after being taken from his mother. And when he goes to them for help, they turn their backs on him. He's a baby, you bitches! What's wrong with you?
* Timothy Mouse is a good proxy for the viewer, earnest and supportive, in the same vein as Jiminy Cricket in *Pinocchio*, and especially useful because Dumbo doesn't speak.
* The elephant pyramid sequence is impressive and suspenseful, with a real sense of weight to it. You can feel the sense of precariousness through the screen, and the catastrophic payoff is priceless.
* So, poor Dumbo is a clown now. Everyone talks about the racial stereotypes, but this is another thing that wouldn't play well with modern audiences; nobody wants to see a baby elephant bullied and abused like the clowns do here.
* The 'Baby Mine' sequence, where Dumbo visits his incarcerated mother, is a sweet one. It could be a lot sadder, given its context, but Dumbo and his mother are just so happy to see each other, and their reunion is marked mostly by smiles, not tears.
* This is soon followed, of course, by 'Pink Elephants on Parade', possibly a highlight of the film. The sequence is striking, frenetic, and even a little spooky.
* The crows may be racial stereotypes, but they're great characters all the same. They're snappy and funny, and even when they're making fun of Dumbo, they don't come off as especially mean. The song 'When I See an Elephant Fly' is a delight, and has become the film's signature.
* The moment when Dumbo takes flight at the circus (and takes his playful revenge on his tormentors) is genuinely triumphant. And we're relieved, too, to know that Dumbo will be treated better from now on.

**In Conclusion**

*Dumbo* is a simple movie. It's short and sweet, and it isn't as great a work of art as its predecessors in the WDAS canon. Nevertheless, it's a fun, charming, and joyful romp from start to finish, and perfectly encapsulates the Disney method of storytelling, despite its lower budget and abbreviated running time. A classic for a reason, it overcomes its shortcomings (and its problematic caricatures) with style and flair.

Recommendations for Christmas-themed Shows/Movies," 

Dear DisneyPlus Reddit community,

I hope this message finds you all doing well. As strange as it may seem, my kids and I love to watch Christmas-themed TV shows and movies all year round. Even though it's the month of May, we still find comfort in watching animated series with lots of Christmas episodes or any content that exudes the holiday spirit.

However, I find myself in a difficult situation lately. My mother passed away (she was living us for the past couple of years), and I am now raising two kids on my own. It's been a struggle, and I feel that watching these kinds of shows could help us feel a little bit better and bring some much-needed joy to our lives.

I'm reaching out to this community because I'm hoping to get some recommendations on the best shows or movies available on DisneyPlus that have a lot of Christmas episodes or themes. I know that there are many people out there who share our love for the holiday season, and I believe that this community can help us find some great content to enjoy together.

So, if you have any suggestions or recommendations, I would be incredibly grateful. Thank you in advance for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you.

"Your thoughts on ""Fantasia"" (1940)","https://preview.redd.it/ockd6dgcngya1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14b6faa63076507d44d16a9d01cd39c77dc6b07a

**Overview**

*Fantasia* was originally conceived as a larger vehicle for the Mickey Mouse feature *The Sorcerer's Apprentice*, which had become too elaborate and expensive to be released on its own. With seven additional animated segments set to diverse pieces of classical music, *Fantasia* is a bold and unusual experiment in the Disney canon.

**Point by Point**

* I don't have as much to say about *Fantasia* as I do the other features in the WDAS catalogue. I'm not a connoisseur of classical music, or of music in general, nor am I an expert on the art of animation. With no real narrative to the piece, I'm limited in the criticisms I can offer. The sequences are fine, though not particularly awe-inspiring by today's measure. I found the first segment, Toccata and Fugue in D minor, mostly boring. I enjoyed much of *The Nutcracker Suite*, however, with its cute dancing mushrooms, and the fairies adding dabs of light to flower petals and spider webs as the seasons change.
* *The Sorcerer's Apprentice* is still the star of the show. A redesigned Mickey Mouse (more expressive and less simplistic than in his prior appearances) is well fitted to the role of the hapless protagonist who finds control of the situation spinning rapidly away from him.
* *Rite of Spring* is pretty good too. It opens on a primordial Earth in the process of being formed. Volcanos erupt in steam and sparks, bubbles of magma burst thickly, and rivers of lava course over the land. A quick evolution of life underwater gives birth to the age of dinosaurs. People in the 1930s knew even less about dinosaurs than we do today, and the creatures look quaint and anatomically incorrect. The T-Rex is a devilish monster, enough to send scores of herbivores scrambling for cover. We watch as it wins a brief fight with a Stegosaurus. Then we fast forward to the dinosaurs' ignominious extinction, treated to the sight of several species on a death march together across a dry, blighted plain. Some are trapped in mud or tar, and are too weak to free themselves. Even the fearsome T-Rex collapses from exhaustion amidst a veritable smorgasbord of potential meals.
* *The Pastoral Symphony* is a good segment, with unicorns, cherubs, and centaurs all romping in a meadow with Bacchus, god of wine, before Zeus shows up to rain on their parade. To be honest, however, I was getting pretty bored with the format by this time.
* I enjoyed the comedy of *Dance of the Hours*, with the ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators all messing around. *Night on Bald Mountain*, unfortunately, came off as much weaker than I had anticipated. Of course, it's possible I was just done at this point.

**In Conclusion**

I don't want to run down *Fantasia*, I really don't. It's a tremendous achievement in animation and sound, and it deserves reverence. I promise I'm not a Philistine. I suspect, however, that it might be impossible to fully appreciate it in this day and age, eighty years later, after the art form has come so far. Sure, back in 1940 it was tremendous; it was mind-blowing. But today it's a relic. I went into this hoping to experience some feeling, some emotion, maybe even some awe. But instead I was just bored most of the time. As much as I have respect for it, I'm afraid *Fantasia* is destined to occupy a low tier in my personal ranking.

So I figured out why my Disney+ password keeps changing,"Tell me if this sounds familiar. You go to use Disney+ and, surprise, you're logged out, again. You already use a password manager and a ridiculously complex password, and you didn't get so much as an email that this happened again, and you've changed your ridiculously complex password to a NEW ridiculously complex password \*three times this year already,\* so you're not changing it again. ""Whoever wants to use this account can use it, I don't care anymore, but you're gonna leave the password to the last good password I set it to."" So you change it back to what it should be.

Couple days later, you or someone else in the house clicks on Hulu. ""Dad, can you log me into Hulu again?"" That's weird. Log in, password incorrect. It's spreading! This is bullcrap, I'm changing that password back to the ridiculously-complex password my password manager knows it should be. Done, log in, now Hulu works again.

""Babe, can you log into Disney+ on the TV again?""

This will repeat until you are committed.

This is the worst service in the world, I'd tell myself! What are they, logging out all devices every 24 hours? Why would you do that? Who does that. And this is an extremely low-value target service/login to try and hack; it's input-only, there's no way to get into someone's account and get any money or anything out of Disney+. So why would someone change our password to something else, over and over and over?

They weren't, it was us, because, and this is literally the only instance I've found of this information anywhere on the internet:

Your Hulu password is the same as your Disney+ password. Changing one changes them both, invisibly, and logs you out of all devices on both services.

Why would this be the case! Hulu was a service set up as a partnership between like NBC and other networks, it was a service for all the network shows to stream from alongside Netflix for movies a decade or more ago. What do they have to do with Disney?

Apparently Disney has majority ownership over it now. So they decided to implement a ""seamless login experience"" across their services, like Disney+ and Hulu, but without telling any customers of Disney+, Hulu, or the rest of the Internet.

But it's true! That's how it works.

So, if you use a password manager, go do yourself a favor right now. Pick either your Hulu or D+ password and try to log into it WITHOUT changing your password if it's wrong. It will probably let you log into one of them.

Whichever one works, go to your password manager entry for it and copy the password. Now, find your password manager entry for the other service, and paste that same password in there and save it. There!

And now the answer to this problem is anywhere on the Internet.

Rewatched Coco again for Cinco De Mayo.,"

As good as the Spanish voice acting has been in this dub, it was a bit disappointing to see that the film wasn't fully adapted for the language in terms of lip synching, especially since the dub had its own separate tab on the service, but I got used to it at least. man does this film still hold up spectacularly.

"Your Thoughts on ""Pinocchio"" (1940)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z9e3yy0il0ya1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a995bca83a303ae3d6a2cdb91752fdcf1c7ae6c

 Based on the best-selling children's novel *The Adventures of Pinocchio* by Italian author Carlo Collodi, Disney's follow-up to their smash hit *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* came along a full three years later, and at just the wrong time. World War II cut off access to European and Asian markets, and *Pinocchio*, through no fault of its own, was a box office failure upon its initial release. The film wouldn't make a profit until its re-release in 1945. Despite this, it's become legendary over the decades, and is widely regarded as one of the best films in the Disney canon.

**Point by Point**

* We open with Jiminy Cricket singing 'When You Wish Upon a Star' over the title sequence. It's a nice song, it won an Academy Award the following year, and it's become the de facto anthem for the Disney company itself. It seems old-hat these days when you hear it played over the castle logo at the start of every film, but, in this context, it's easy to understand its appeal.
* As nice as *Snow White* looks, the visuals of *Pinocchio* far surpass it. Everything is so bright and colorful and vibrant, the animation is buttery smooth, and the music and sound effects integrate themselves flawlessly. Groundbreaking effects animation (rain, lightning, smoke, shadows, etc.) make the world seem alive. From here you can definitely glimpse what spectacle Disney will go on to achieve in the future.
* Geppetto is a funny, likable character, and his absentmindedness and frequent befuddlement are rich sources of comedy. His pets Figaro and Cleo are cute. Pinocchio, too, is much more likable and endearing here. In the source novel, Pinocchio is kind of a dick; spiteful, selfish, lazy, and always needing to learn his lessons the hard way. When the film's Pinocchio gets led astray, it's due more to an innocence and naivety befitting one who has just been born.
* The con men Honest John and Gideon whom Pinocchio encounters on his way to school aren't presented as villains so much as a malevolent force of nature. They're so overbearing and irresistible, it's as though they represent all the evils of the world crashing over the fresh-faced, inexperienced Pinocchio like a pounding wave. You get the sense that Pinocchio's encounter with them, and all that they represent, is inevitable. If he had taken a completely different path to school, he still would have met them in some shape or form.
* You don't notice it watching the movie as a child, but Jiminy Cricket is utterly useless. His job is to be Pinocchio's ""conscience"", and to guide him on the straight and narrow, but, after Pinocchio is drafted into Stromboli's puppet theater, Jiminy walks out on him! And he does the same thing again on Pleasure Island, after Pinocchio falls in with Lampwick. And where is Jiminy while Pinocchio and Geppetto are trapped inside of Monstro? He's outside, floating in a bottle. Jiminy Cricket has become one of Disney's most memorable and iconic characters, but he doesn't actually *do* anything.
* 'I've Got No Strings' is a fun and lively number, with Pinocchio accompanied by international flavors of marionettes. It might just be the first real toe-tapper in the WDAS songbook.
* The nose-growing sequence, where Pinocchio is confronted by the Blue Fairy about his misbehavior, is a perfect example of Disney's penchant for taking something fanciful and making it even more so. In the book, Pinocchio's nose grows when he lies. In the movie, his nose not only grows, it sprouts leaves; and flowers; and even a nest, complete with birds and eggs! Disney takes every whimsical thing from the story they're adapting and adds even more color and fancy.
* The fate of the boys on Pleasure Island seems pretty harsh. So they wanted to play and have a good time instead of going to school. Can you blame them? And for all that, they end up transformed into unspeaking beasts of burden bound for the salt mines. But that's old timey morality tales for you. Disobey your parents and your life is irrevocably ruined.
* The underwater landscapes, while Pinocchio treads the ocean floor on his search for Geppetto, are really striking and beautiful, and the wavy water effects are, for lack of a better term, highly immersive. Up until that point in animation history, it was probably the best that a sub-aquatic environment had ever looked.
* It's clear that Pinocchio has grown immensely by this point in the story. When he hears that Geppetto is *inside of a whale*, he takes off for the ocean without a second thought. And when he finally reunites with Geppetto inside the belly of said whale, he devises a clever escape plan almost immediately. He has indeed become brave, truthful, and unselfish, just as the Blue Fairy directed him.
* I won't lie; as a little kid, I was scared of Monstro. His size, his bellows, his angry yellow eyes, his gaping maw full of teeth. An immense, unstoppable force of nature. The dread of Pinocchio and Geppetto all by themselves on a tiny raft in the middle of the open ocean, fragile and vulnerable as a hateful beast the size of a football field bears down on them. A suspenseful, nail-biting climax to the adventure.
* And, of course, the joyous final scene, when Pinocchio is revived from death as a real boy. It's not just his reward, but ours too, for sharing the journey with him.

**In Conclusion**

It's hard to believe that *Pinocchio* was only Disney's second animated feature film. It's such a masterful example of the art form, you'd think they'd been at it for much longer. It's a fun and lively adventure, beautifully crafted, full of humor and heart, populated by many larger-than-life characters. The fact that Disney's next project following this one was *Fantasia* speaks volumes about the confidence the studio had rightly earned.

**Current Ranking**

1. Pinocchio
2. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs",21,0.92,7,Key-Win7744,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1683293281.0,False,False,False,2023-05-05 13:28:01,based on the bestselling childrens novel the adventures of pinocchio by italian author carlo collodi disneys followup to their smash hit snow white and the seven dwarfs came along a full three years later and at just the wrong time world war ii cut off access to european and asian markets and pinocchio through no fault of its own was a box office failure upon its initial release the film wouldnt make a profit until its rerelease in despite this its become legendary over the decades and is widely regarded as one of the best films in the disney canon point by point we open with jiminy cricket singing when you wish upon a star over the title sequence its a nice song it won an academy award the following year and its become the de facto anthem for the disney company itself it seems oldhat these days when you hear it played over the castle logo at the start of every film but in this context its easy to understand its appeal as nice as snow white looks the visuals of pinocchio far surpass it everything is so bright and colorful and vibrant the animation is buttery smooth and the music and sound effects integrate themselves flawlessly groundbreaking effects animation rain lightning smoke shadows etc make the world seem alive from here you can definitely glimpse what spectacle disney will go on to achieve in the future geppetto is a funny likable character and his absentmindedness and frequent befuddlement are rich sources of comedy his pets figaro and cleo are cute pinocchio too is much more likable and endearing here in the source novel pinocchio is kind of a dick spiteful selfish lazy and always needing to learn his lessons the hard way when the films pinocchio gets led astray its due more to an innocence and naivety befitting one who has just been born the con men honest john and gideon whom pinocchio encounters on his way to school arent presented as villains so much as a malevolent force of nature theyre so overbearing and irresistible its as though they represent all the evils of the world crashing over the freshfaced inexperienced pinocchio like a pounding wave you get the sense that pinocchios encounter with them and all that they represent is inevitable if he had taken a completely different path to school he still would have met them in some shape or form you dont notice it watching the movie as a child but jiminy cricket is utterly useless his job is to be

"Your thoughts on ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937)","Lately I've been binging my way through the complete Walt Disney Animation Studios catalog on Disney+, from *Snow White* to *Strange World*, and it occurred to me that it might be fun and enlightening to have a community discussion on each of them. These movies, in many cases, are legendary, and have helped to inform our childhoods. And as you watch them again in adulthood, you notice all sorts of new things about them. So what I've been doing is sitting down with each of the movies and taking notes on anything I find particularly noteworthy, be it a positive or a negative, and compiling a sort of mini-review, providing some talking points to build on. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the movies as well.

 **Overview**

In the 1930s, Disney sat atop the animation heap with their Mickey Mouse and their Donald Duck and their Oscar-winning series of *Silly Symphony* shorts, but Walt wanted still more. With the promise of greater storytelling possibilities and the allure of greater than ever profits, Disney and his company set out to produce the world's first full-length animated feature. It was a long, arduous, and expensive labor that many in the industry referred to derisively as ""Disney's folly"", but, when all was said and done, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* was hailed a masterpiece, and even held the record briefly for highest-grossing sound film (until *Gone With the Wind* came along two years later). To this day it's still the highest-grossing animated film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), and is a tremendous influence on everything that followed.

**Point by Point**

* We open with the now familiar storybook introduction; the first of many (and parodied to great effect in *Shrek*). It's an effective means of getting a certain amount of exposition out of the way and setting the scene for the audience.
* Right away the visual style and animation is worlds ahead of anything Disney had turned out previously. I watched a few of their *Silly Symphony* features to compare, and this really is so much more sophisticated. From the first look at the evil Queen's castle as the madwoman herself approaches her Magic Mirror, we know we're witnessing something special. If you can put yourself in the mindset of a 1930s moviegoer seeing this for the first time on the big screen, it's all the more rewarding.
* The filmmakers do a tremendous job of presenting Snow White as a joyful, transcendent, almost ephemeral presence. After the brief first scene focusing on the Queen in her dark chambers, the switch to Snow White, surrounded by doves, scrubbing the castle steps with a smile on her rosy face, accomplishes such a change in mood that it actually made me smile. This girl has been onscreen for all of half a minute and she already has *all* my sympathy. I want good things for her. She is indeed fairer than the Queen, not so much in looks as in disposition and gentle nature.
* The brief, sudden courtship between Snow White and the traveling Prince is effective. Yes, yes, they've fallen in love at first sight. What of it? It's a fairy tale, that's how these stories work. Though the scene is short, with the Prince serenading Snow White perched on her balcony above, there's definitely substance to this defining moment in a romance that will surely endure unto the end of both characters' lives. At one point, Snow White sends a dove fluttering down to the Prince. The dove perches on the Prince's hand, blushes coquettishly, then gives him a gentle peck before flying off. I'm not stupid, I can pick up on subtext. That dove was a proxy for the passion between these new lovers.
*  The sense of menace and dread is real in the scene where the evil Queen orders her Huntsman to murder Snow White and carve out her heart for a souvenir. Anybody familiar with the story of Snow White must have known that awful directive was due, but I still can't help but wonder how audiences of the time may have reacted to something so gruesome.
* Snow White's flight into the dark forest is a sequence of terror, bringing out the princess' fear and desperation, with gnarled tree branches that seem as cloying hands, and pits like gaping maws to swallow her up. Even logs floating in the river become ravenous alligators to Snow White's eyes. The filmmakers are telling an awesome story so far, and we're only ten minutes in!
* Then the tension crescendos, and, as Snow White's terror and despair subside, we see it's not so bad. Indeed, the sun peeks through the branches, and all the eyes watching the princess from the shadows are revealed to belong to cute, friendly herbivores. And what does Snow White do now? She begins to sing, of course! She meets even her attempted murder and her exile from home with easy grace. No wonder that Mirror thinks she's so damn fair!
* The sequence of Snow White and her new animal friends tidying up the dwarfs' cottage, to the tune of 'Whistle While You Work', is fun, and, stylistically, it's the forebear of many, many like sequences to come in future movies.
* The dwarfs toiling merrily in their diamond mine, then marching home to the tune of 'Heigh-Ho', is a joyful introduction to the rest of the main cast, and the flabbergasted dwarfs investigating their tidied cabin is a good opportunity for gags, as well as to show off each dwarf's unique personality. (Doc takes command, Grumpy is suspicious and cynical, Dopey is clumsy, etc.) The other dwarfs unanimously volunteering Dopey to go upstairs and investigate further is priceless.
* Though it may be difficult to believe, the dwarfs in the original Grimm tale were largely nondescript from each other, and lacked even their own, individual names. Say what you will about Disney twisting, bastardizing, and sanitizing its sources, but they doubtless make improvements as well. Its their doing that these stories are so universally well-known and beloved to this day, and if the price we pay is losing some of the gore and cruelty, I can live with that.
* The Queen's transformation into the ugly old Witch bears an air of ceremony, as though we're witnessing something pivotal. Also, imagine how much the Queen must loathe Snow White. She prizes nothing above her own physical beauty, so much so that she's willing to murder to defend it, and yet she's willing to transform herself into this hideous, gnarled crone, however temporarily, just to get to her stepdaughter. She becomes what she fears and despises most in the world, just so she can have the chance to inflict suffering on an innocent child.
* The subsequent scene of the party at the dwarfs' cottage, with singing and dancing and messing about, is full of joy and good humor, and Snow White gives us a reprise of 'Someday My Prince Will Come', just in case we've forgotten about her true love. I will fight for Snow White. Put a sword in my hand and point me in the direction of the Queen.
* The creepy vultures following the Witch to the dwarfs' cottage adds an extra layer of menace to the proceedings. They are the grim specter of death trailing in her wake. When she arrives at the cottage and accosts Snow White alone, we really do feel a twinge of fear for the unsuspecting princess. Somebody get the dwarfs back here, now!
*  The dwarfs are too late to save Snow White, but not too late to avenge her. Without fear or quavering in their hearts, they chase the Witch doggedly against a sudden thunderstorm. The Witch attempts to roll a giant boulder down onto her pursuers, but God or irony (whichever you prefer) intervenes, and a well-placed bolt of lightning sends both her and the boulder plummeting to a satisfying finish. The vultures have their meal.
* A brief, sad moment, as we see the dwarfs mourn for Snow White in her glass coffin. But then, just as simply and suddenly as he appeared before, the Prince returns! He bestows love's first kiss, Snow White wakes up, and they live happily ever after! (In the Grimm tale, Snow White is revived by the dislodging from her throat of the bite of poisonous apple when the Prince attempts to move her coffin, but I think this is infinitely better.)

**In Conclusion**

It's the first step on a long journey, and I'm sure *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* will be overtaken many times in days and weeks to come, but that doesn't diminish the quality and magic of this first entry in the Disney canon. Disney put their best foot forward with this fledgling effort, and if it hadn't been so well-received, we likely wouldn't have any of the others that followed. A solid, worthy film to start us off.

The hidden message of Pleasure Island in both the 1940 and 2022 Pinocchio movies,"In both the 1940 and 2022 Pinocchio movies, there are places on Pleasure Island **made specifically** for doing things which would be considered misbehaving such as roughhousing, vandalizing a building, destroying things, but what appears to justify the kids being turned into donkeys in the original movie is the fact that they smoke and drink alcohol. However, in the 2022 movie there is no smoking -- out of respect to Walt Disney who died at the relatively young age of 65 because he was a heavy smoker -- and the kids do not knowingly drink alcohol, so a number of people have stated that the kids are being punished for having fun and are not misbehaving because this place was made specifically for shoplifting, vandalism, etc., etc. Personally, I feel if you showed either movie to a kid, they would understand that shoplifting, vandalism, theft, insulting each other, roughhousing, playing with fireworks and firecrackers is wrong.

I feel that Pleasure Island has another message in both movies. The message is NOT that eating candy, drinking root beer, going on amusement park rides and doing fun things which are part of the game is bad, it's that kids need to be aware that things which are too good to be true are a scam/probably false and if they're gullible enough will believe to be real. If they're not careful bad things can happen -- not turned into a donkey and be sold for a profit or anything like that, but still bad things can happen or it's not what they thought it was.

The kids probably only learned about Pleasure Island either from flyers or from a COMPLETE STRANGER that they likely met for the first time that night, not from anybody they know who has actually been there and experienced it. If Pleasure Island is such a wonderful place for kids to go to and so close to home then why haven’t these kids heard of it before? Parents would see an exotic Disneyland or Disneyworld like place (essentially in their own backyard which they probably never heard of before) with no rules or adults where kids can have all the candy and root beer they want, and has places where shoplifting, stealing things from each other, vandalizing schools, breaking clocks, insulting each other, sword fight with firecrackers, and shoot fireworks at each other is legal and can do it at will without any consequences is very fishy, but the kids won't think this is fishy and if they don't suspect anything fishy bad things can happen to them.

Don't talk to, go anywhere with a stranger, or take anything from a stranger.

Even in the 1940 movie, Jiminy Cricket finds the place to be phony and wants to get Pinocchio off the island. The saying ""stupid little boys"" doesn't necessarily mean they're naughty little boys, but they're Very Gullible. In real life there have been children or people in their late teens-early 20s which have been lured to someone or into their house for reasons which are not wrong, and they are duped and killed or held captive.

The film stars Ever Gabo Anderson from Black Widow, and Jude Law from the Fantastic Beasts franchise.
 
Wendy Darling (Ever Gabo Anderson) doesn’t want to go to boarding school since she has no desire to grow up. The night before she is supposed to go to boarding school, she and her two brothers John Darling (Joshua Pickering) and Michael Darling (Jacobi Jupe) meet Peter Pan (Alexander Molony.) With the help of Tinker Bell (Yara Shahidi) and happy thoughts, they all fly to Neverland, a place where children don’t have to grow up. Once there, they run into pirates led by Captain Hook (Jude Law).
 
This live action version of the story of Peter Pan was better than the original 1993 film. Unlike the original, this film gives the characters somewhat of a backstory; with Hook and Pan previously being friends, along with Wendy and Tinker Bell forming a new friendship.
 
Molony wasn’t as convincing playing Pan as he could have been. He didn’t form any bonds with the other characters. When Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanatahk) appeared on screen she showed the audience what an excellent rider she was, as well as helping out the other characters.
 
With different actors playing Pan and Wendy, they might have been able to form a connection with other characters. Even though this film has its flaws, the fact that the characters had more of a backstory and some characters form friendships, it makes the film more enjoyable for adults rather than children.",0,0.5,1,Kimfun23,:Review: Review,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1682901222.0,False,False,False,2023-05-01 00:33:42,disney has remade their animated peter pan film into a live action peter pan and wendy film directed by david lowery who also directed the live action petes dragon the film stars ever gabo anderson from black widow and jude law from the fantastic beasts franchise wendy darling ever gabo anderson doesnt want to go to boarding school since she has no desire to grow up the night before she is supposed to go to boarding school she and her two brothers john darling joshua pickering and michael darling jacobi jupe meet peter pan alexander molony with the help of tinker bell yara shahidi and happy thoughts they all fly to neverland a place where children dont have to grow up once there they run into pirates led by captain hook jude law this live action version of the story of peter pan was better than the original film unlike the original this film gives the characters somewhat of a backstory with hook and pan previously being friends along with wendy and tinker bell forming a new friendship molony wasnt as convincing playing pan as he could have been he didnt form any bonds with the other characters when tiger lily alyssa wapanatahk appeared on screen she showed the audience what an excellent rider she was as well as helping out the other characters with different actors playing pan and wendy they might have been able to form a connection with other characters even though this film has its flaws the fact that the characters had more of a backstory and some characters form friendships it makes the film more enjoyable for adults rather than children,my peter pan and wendy review,1

"Your thoughts on ""Strange World"" (2022)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b54u98yoq6nb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec81ccf094af3c4392ca0deab879b2b6ae88a1a2

**Overview**

*Strange World* is an adventure story that draws inspiration from old sci fi stories in pulp magazines, and movies like *Journey to the Center of the Earth* and *Fantastic Voyage*. It was a huge bomb at the box office (performing worse than Pixar's *Lightyear*), but I don't think Disney ever believed in it or cared about it, and their almost nonexistent advertising for the film bears that out. Affected by a number of factors (such as the public willingness to wait for animated movies to stream on Disney+, and the controversial presence of the studio's first openly LGBT character), Disney seemingly sent *Strange World* out to die and put all their focus into bigger contemporary films like *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* and *Avatar: The Way of Water*.

**Point by Point**

* *Strange World* opens with celebrated explorer Jaeger Clade and his tag-along son Searcher attempting to breach the mountains that surround their insular country of Avalonia, as no one has ever ventured past them. After a good-looking set piece in a collapsing ice cave, Searcher discovers a plant growing nearby that generates electricity (which Avalonia has not yet discovered and harnessed). Searcher wants to take the plant back to the people of Avalonia, but Jaeger stubbornly insists on continuing the expedition past the mountains, so the two end up going their separate ways.
* Twenty-five years later, Searcher and his family (wife Meridian and son Ethan) are farmers, providing Avalonia with crops of the electric plant (now called Pando) it needs in order to power society. Just as Searcher rejected his father's expectations for him years ago, however, his own son Ethan isn't so sure he wants to inherit the farm. The town is pretty and well lit, and the overall aesthetic really puts me in mind of Columbia in *Bioshock Infinite*.
* For reasons unknown, Pando crops all over are dying, so Searcher joins an expedition to find out why, and what can be done to save it. Pando is actually a singular organism deep underground, putting out tendrils all over the surface, and the expedition intends to travel to the “heart of Pando”. Predictably, Searcher's adventurous son stows away, and Mom follows both of them. There's also a three-legged dog named Legend who ends up getting into all sorts of endearing mischief.
* The world beneath the surface looks really good, and is populated with weird flora and fauna. Before long they discover Jaeger, who's been trapped down here all this time. This provides some opportunities for family drama and heart-to-heart chats, none of which is very interesting. There are some good action set pieces, however, including fights with the local creatures and a voyage across an acidic sea.
* Ultimately, the characters find out that their world is actually an immense, turtle-like creature, and that they've been traveling through its insides this whole time! Not only that, Pando is an infection that's killing the creature and must be destroyed! (A bit on the nose, I think. Avalonia's source of power is killing their world and they have to give it up? Okay, Disney, you first, but good luck running your amusement parks on just wind and solar.)

**In Conclusion**

*Strange World* is strikingly reminiscent of *Atlantis: The Lost Empire*. It's a low-key adventure story with gradual pacing, character development, and slightly more grown-up themes. I can't see young children being very captivated by it. Like *Atlantis*, I think it will be re-evaluated in due time. For now, I rank it Okay.

"Confused on my bundle, about the planned price increase, and the options to change bundles.","**SOLVED:**

Sorry for the lengthy post but I'm scratching my head on this.

&#x200B;

I signed up for the Disney+ bundle when it first started. Wanting Hulu no ads, I upgraded my Hulu plan to the ad-free plan. Never touched my accounts since then...

When I look at my Disney+ account, it shows I have the ""Legacy Disney Bundle"" for $15/month.

So right now, I'm getting charged $15/month when I check my Hulu account and $7/month when I check my Disney+ account. So total $22/month. So yeah I've been paying $2/month total more now than the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

Got the email from saying  ""The price of Disney Bundle Trio Basic will increase on October 12, 2023 to $14.99/month. The price change will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 12."" But I don't have that bundle.

...

When the increase happens, my Hulu plan will increase to $18/month (says when I check on my account page)...not sure what my Disney+ will charge me. If it's still $7/month, I'm fine with that since that equals the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

But if Disney+ will charge more then I want to change my bundle. BUT...i don't see any.

"Your thoughts on ""Encanto"" (2021)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Released during the reign of COVID, *Encanto* enjoyed just thirty days of theatrical exclusivity before being released (at no premium) on Disney+. It found an audience on the streaming platform, however, and became widely successful and acclaimed, due in no small part to its hit soundtrack. It may not have been met with as much prestige and fanfare as *Frozen* or *Moana*, but I'd say its place among the Disney animated musicals of its era is assured.

**Point by Point**

* As usual, the visuals are amazing and colorful throughout. The opening song, 'The Family Madrigal', is a good way of introducing the various members of the clan and their special abilities. I did have to turn on subtitles in order to understand the lyrics, however.
* Grandma Alma has been through a lot. When her children were just babies, she and her husband had to flee some unspecified coup or revolution, and her husband was killed. The miracle occurred then, and created a safe place for the fleeing peasants to live. She's been holding tightly onto that ever since, afraid of it slipping away, and she's reached the point where the magic and the gifts have become the point of it all; the family must serve the miracle, rather than the other way around. She runs the family like a corporation, and applies her family's gifts and talents where she believes they'll do the most good for the community. Thus, the super-strong Luisa spends her days fetching runaway donkeys and holding up collapsing buildings, and Isabela – seen as the “golden child” - is pressured into an arranged marriage for the sake of more offspring with more miraculous powers. Meanwhile, Bruno, Alma's own son, ultimately chooses exile because his power to see the future is unpredictable and problematic.
* As the movie begins with young Antonio about to receive his gift (which turns out to be the ability to communicate with animals), we get a good look at how it all works. Each member of the family receives a huge, magical room (extradimensional in nature, as each room appears bigger than the entire house) that reflects their special gift. Mirabel, of course, never got one, and it's easy to relate to her. She overcompensates in her daily life, trying so hard to serve the family in any way she can, while feeling like she's less special than everyone else around her. Her song, 'Waiting on a Miracle', which she performs as everyone gathers around and celebrates Antonio, conveys the appropriate feelings of longing and disappointment. I really did feel sorry for her here.
* Luisa and Isabela both have great character development songs, with 'Surface Pressure' and 'What Else Can I Do?' respectively. I'm not sure why 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' was such a hit. It's just okay, it's no 'Let It Go'. Bruno is an interesting character, though, and likable; quirky, in a Jeff Goldblum sort of way. It's sad that he's been living in the walls for about a decade and no one has noticed.
* Mirabel's reconciliation with Alma at the river is a good moment. All along it's seemed as though Alma has regarded Mirabel as an emblem of failure and bad fortune, even if she didn't mean to, so it's nice to hear her give Mirabel some validation. She realizes now that she's been missing the point lately, and has been sacrificing the family to feed the miracle, but Mirabel reassures her in turn, pointing out that the miracle happened *because* of Alma.

**In Conclusion**

*Encanto* is fun, colorful, and dramatic, with good characters and good songs, and it handles the subject of a large, quirky family a lot more capably than *Meet the Robinsons* does. I don't quite rank it an S, but there's no question it belongs among the Greats.

"Your thoughts on ""Frozen II"" (2019)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a8bjxoookllb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cf7ad8a4498d86a263c0c4bb7c924d41d2ea652

**Overview**

As phenomenally successful as *Frozen* was, a sequel was all but inevitable, and the talent behind the original movie returned to continue the story. *Frozen II* sees Elsa struggling with her destiny, being pulled in opposite directions between her role as queen of Arendelle and the allure of some enigmatic spiritual force. Meanwhile, Kristoff is making plans to propose to Anna, and Olaf has a new “permafrost” (the personal flurry Elsa gave him at the end of *Frozen* proved difficult to animate).

**Point by Point**

* *Frozen II* looks great, there's no denying that. The autumnal scenery (particularly within the Enchanted Forest) is gorgeous. I'm glad they went with autumn as a design choice. We've already seen plenty of lush, green forests in summertime, and, for the world of Frozen, the crisp, windswept days of fall strike a more natural note. There are so many excellent set pieces; the bleak desolation of the area surrounding the shipwreck; the scene with Elsa charging determinedly at the sea and wrestling with the water spirit; and the destruction of the dam by the earth giants, resulting in the huge tidal wave coursing towards Arendelle.
* The music, however, doesn't live up to that of its predecessor. I found most of the songs to be pretty drab. 'Into the Unknown' and 'Show Yourself' are the only standouts, in my opinion, and neither of them approaches the greatness of 'Let It Go'. Having said that, the 'Show Yourself' sequence is very impressive. The emotion on Elsa's face when she sees her mother is wonderfully captured, and so lifelike.
* I find the story of *Frozen II* mostly uninteresting, and it tends to drag. I do appreciate what the filmmakers do with Elsa's personal journey, however. Although it's not stated bluntly, it's pretty obvious that Elsa, at the beginning of the movie, is feeling unfulfilled with her life on the throne of a small kingdom. The insular world of Arendelle isn't enough for her, even if she doesn't know it yet. When she hears some far off voice calling her, she throws herself into the quest immediately, and, when she's forced to use her powers to overcome the angry spirits that greet her and her traveling companions, you can tell she's absolutely loving it. The scene where she's on her own, fighting the ocean and wrestling for her life against that water horse thing? That's all she's ever wanted. In the end, she makes Anna the queen of Arendelle, and stays out there. She's too big for Arendelle; too wild. Now she's free.

**In Conclusion**

*Frozen II* is beautiful to look at, has a couple of great songs, and gives Elsa a satisfying arc. Those things are what carry the movie for me. The whole package is definitely less than the sum of its parts. Instead of watching the entire movie again, I'm more likely to just watch 'Show Yourself' on YouTube.

**Overview**

WDAS movies don't often receive sequels. At this point in time, *The Rescuers* had been the only one to do so. The makers of *Wreck-It Ralph* evidently believed they had more to say, however, so, in this latest adventure, Ralph and Vanellope have to use the arcade's new Wi-Fi router to enter the Internet and find a replacement part for Vanellope's *Sugar Rush* game before it's scrapped. This gives the filmmakers the opportunity to comment on Internet culture and phenomena, in much the same way the original film explored the nuances of video gaming.

**Point by Point**

* The film starts off kind of slow, although we do get to enjoy some more cameos from video game celebrities like Chun Li and Sonic the Hedgehog. From the outset we're given a glimpse at the conflicts that will define the story; Vanellope is feeling bored and unfulfilled, and Ralph is displaying unhealthy attachment to her. Things pick up a bit when they finally make it onto the Internet. The film's concept of the cyber world is a vast city, with Amazon, Snapchat, and Google embodied by mighty skyscrapers, and Internet users represented by cute little avatars. When they find out they need actual money in order to acquire a *Sugar Rush* steering wheel, they initially get into loot hunting, and are tasked with stealing a high-value racing vehicle from a semi-apocalyptic MMO called *Slaughter Race*. The owner of the car, Shank, isn't having it, but she does teach Ralph and Vanellope how to go viral for bucks instead.
* While Ralph is busy making an ass of himself for likes, Vanellope ends up on a Disney website for fans. 'Let It Go' rings through the air, and characters like Buzz Lightyear, Baymax, Iron Man, and Eeyore mill about. Then, of course, there's the Disney princess segment. I guess some people like it, but...I don't. I think it's really, really cringe. Like, embarrassingly so. I was embarrassed while watching it. (The scene at the end of the film, when they all join together to help rescue Ralph, is a bit better.)
* The story never really gets interesting, and is predictable throughout. Gee, I wonder if Vanellope is going to decide to stay in *Slaughter Race*. Gee, I wonder if Ralph is going to regret unleashing that clearly dangerous virus. Gee, I wonder if Ralph is going to learn a lesson about respecting boundaries. Even the climax is kind of blah, because it's just Ralph facing his own insecurities; there's no actual antagonist.
* And the movie ends with Vanellope going Turbo. She goes Turbo and leaves *Sugar Rush* for *Slaughter Race*. The whole point of *Wreck-It Ralph* is that you don't go Turbo; it causes nothing but trouble. Don't tell me the players won't notice Vanellope is missing from the *Sugar Rush* line-up; at the beginning of the movie, we see a player excitedly pick Vanellope because “she has the best super power”. Going by what we saw in the original *Wreck-It Ralph*, *Sugar Rush* shouldn't be long for this world with the princess of Candy Land or whatever permanently dropped out. But no, never mind the message we sold you in the first movie. Going Turbo is fine.
* All in all, *Ralph Breaks the Internet* doesn't feel like sufficient justification for bringing these characters back in a new movie. The premise isn't very interesting, and the examination of Internet tropes, while amusing for a while, ultimately wears thin. All of the emphasis on memes and Internet-based companies seems kind of crass and soulless; like it won't stand the test of time. The Disney segment, in particular, feels more like blatant self-promotion than cute fan service. And then, of course, there's the complete invalidation of the message of the original movie.

**In Conclusion**

Lacking in heart and substance, and heavy with self-promotion and commercialism, *Ralph Breaks the Internet* feels more akin to an animated movie one would expect from DreamWorks or Illumination, not WDAS. It's definitely one of their weakest films, down there with *The Black Cauldron* and *Chicken Little*.

sequels at this point in time the rescuers had been the only one to do so the makers of wreckit ralph evidently believed they had more to say however so in this latest adventure ralph and vanellope have to use the arcades new wifi router to enter the internet and find a replacement part for vanellopes sugar rush game before its scrapped this gives the filmmakers the opportunity to comment on internet culture and phenomena in much the same way the original film explored the nuances of video gaming point by point the film starts off kind of slow although we do get to enjoy some more cameos from video game celebrities like chun li and sonic the hedgehog from the outset were given a glimpse at the conflicts that will define the story vanellope is feeling bored and unfulfilled and ralph is displaying unhealthy attachment to her things pick up a bit when they finally make it onto the internet the films concept of the cyber world is a vast city with amazon snapchat and google embodied by mighty skyscrapers and internet users represented by cute little avatars when they find out they need actual money in order to acquire a sugar rush steering wheel they initially get into loot hunting and are tasked with stealing a highvalue racing vehicle from a semiapocalyptic mmo called slaughter race the owner of the car shank isnt having it but she does teach ralph and vanellope how to go viral for bucks instead while ralph is busy making an ass of himself for likes vanellope ends up on a disney website for fans let it go rings through the air and characters like buzz lightyear baymax iron man and eeyore mill about then of course theres the disney princess segment i guess some people like it buti dont i think its really really cringe like embarrassingly so i was embarrassed while watching it the scene at the end of the film when they all join together to help rescue ralph is a bit better the story never really gets interesting and is predictable throughout gee i wonder if vanellope is going to decide to stay in slaughter race gee i wonder if ralph is going to regret unleashing that clearly dangerous virus gee i wonder if ralph is going to learn a lesson about respecting boundaries even the climax is kind of blah because its just ralph facing his own insecurities theres no actual antagonist and the movie ends with vanellope going turbo she goes turbo and leaves sugar rush for slaughter race the whole point of wreckit ralph is that you dont go turbo it causes nothing but trouble dont tell me the players wont notice vanellope is missing from the sugar rush lineup at the beginning of the movie we see a player excitedly pick vanellope because she has the best super power going by what we saw in the original wreckit ralph sugar rush shouldnt be long for this world with the princess of candy land or whatever permanently dropped out but no never mind the message we sold you in the first movie going turbo is fine all in all ralph breaks the internet doesnt feel like sufficient justification for bringing these characters back in a new movie the premise isnt very interesting and the examination of internet tropes while amusing for a while ultimately wears thin all of the emphasis on memes and internetbased companies seems kind of crass and soulless like it wont stand the test of time the disney segment in particular feels more like blatant selfpromotion than cute fan service and then of course theres the complete invalidation of the message of the original movie in conclusion lacking in heart and substance and heavy with

**Overview**

John Musker and Ron Clements (directors of *The Little Mermaid*, *Aladdin*, and *The Princess and the Frog*, among others) return to deliver us another beautiful, musical extravaganza, steeped this time in ancient Polynesian culture and mythology.

**Point by Point**

* *Moana* just might be the best-looking WDAS film yet. Everything in it looks amazing, from the vibrant and colorful characters, to the lush vegetation, and especially the water effects. From the beginning of the film to the end, I was consistently aware of the incredible visuals. The music, too, is some of the best in the studio's canon, with songs that are inspiring, powerful, and catchy. The story isn't quite as meaty as that of some of the other great Disney epics, but it's never dull either, and is supplemented by pure, unadulterated spectacle.
* I don't go as greatly into detail on *Moana* as I do with the other Disney films. This is mostly because I have nothing but high praise for every aspect (no low points to speak of), and because *Moana* is so highly acclaimed and still so fresh in memory that anything I have to say would seem extremely obvious and commonplace. I love Moana's indomitable spirit, and she has real chemistry with Maui. Making the ocean an actual character was an inspired move, and the sequence at the beginning, with the ocean interacting with Moana as a toddler, is a great bit. The Realm of Monsters is an awesome set piece, and the encounter with the giant crab is mesmerizing. The initial, failed assault on Te Ka leads to a dramatic “all is lost” moment, where both the ocean and the spirit of Moana's grandmother actually let Moana off the hook, but, in an inspired reaffirmation set to soaring music, she presses on. The final encounter with Te Ka is spectacular, and the twist – in which Te Ka turns out to actually be Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart – is clever.

**In Conclusion**

All in all, I'd say *Moana* is probably the best WDAS film since the 1990s; even better than *Frozen* in many respects. The visuals, the music, the characterization, and the simple yet dramatic story all come together to form one of the studio's highest points. Definitely top tier material.

**Overview**

After Disney acquired Marvel in 2009, CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company's divisions to comb through Marvel's properties for adaptation prospects, and WDAS landed on *Big Hero 6*, a comparatively obscure comic book series set in Japan. More a reinvention than a proper adaptation (the characters and concepts of the comic book stories are dramatically different), *Big Hero 6* gave WDAS the chance to make its own contribution to the landscape of twenty-first century superhero movies.

**Point by Point**

* *Big Hero 6* takes place in a futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo called San Fransokyo. The blending of aesthetics makes for an interesting setting, with the hills and streetcars and Victorian-style houses of San Fran blending together with the neon skyscrapers, elevated trains, and cherry blossoms of Tokyo. It doesn't feel like just another generic superhero metropolis, and it's always interesting to look at.
* Hiro is a likable protagonist; a child prodigy who doesn't know how to apply his genius constructively, spending his time on robot fights. His brother Tadashi shows him his college research lab, where we meet Tadashi's friends and fellow students, and Baymax, whose soft, malleable form and consistently even temperament make him the breakout star of the show. His exceedingly gentle nature and genuine concern for his patient's well-being imbue all of his interactions with a warm, safe feeling that you can sense through the screen. (And the bit when he's low on power and acts drunk is hilarious.) It's fitting that Baymax – Tadashi's creation born out of love – is the one to come to Hiro's emotional rescue after Tadashi's untimely death.
* I'm...honestly not sure how we're supposed to respond to Hiro transforming Baymax into a warrior. Obviously, it's not what he was meant for; it's not what Tadashi intended. It seems a bit disrespectful, as though Hiro is missing the point. At the same time, Hiro is really just endowing him with a suit of armor and a knowledge of martial arts for defense; it's not as though he's giving him sword hands or laser eyes. All in all, considering the way the movie ends (with Baymax as a full-fledged superhero), it feels like we're meant to approve of the changes. For all the good that Baymax can doubtless do as a superhero, however, it's hard to ignore the fact that Tadashi's dream for him won't be realized, and that this “personal healthcare companion” has been repurposed as a soldier.
* The confrontation with the masked villain and the chase through the streets is a good action set piece. The way he manipulates the microbots to become thrusting tendrils is viscerally pleasing; kind of like watching Dr. Octopus in action. This sequence also brings Tadashi's friends to the fore, and we get to know them better. Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred are each dynamic and interesting in their own way, and, despite being just support characters, we get enough focus on them so that they don't feel superfluous. The montage (set to Fall Out Boy's 'Immortals', which was written specifically for *Big Hero 6*) of them adapting their tech interests into their superhero personas is a fun and energizing moment.
* Callaghan has an understandable motive for his wrath, but he comes off as pretty two-dimensional. It's like there's nothing to him *except* his wrath. He tries multiple times to kill his own students when they get in his way, and he expresses absolutely zero remorse for causing Tadashi's death. Was he *ever* a good person? Was he *always* this guy? I get the sense that he'd be willing to sacrifice countless innocent lives on the altar of his vengeance. He's presented as merely the one-note bad guy who exists to be overcome. Some greater nuance to his character and his behavior would have been welcome.
* In an intense moment, Hiro gives in to his rage and grief and reprograms Baymax to become a killing machine. In a jarring and abrupt transformation, Baymax's eyes go red and he lunges at Callaghan with a singleminded intent to kill, brushing the others aside like debris as he does so. I don't really have a problem with the morals of it (the idea that ""heroes don't kill"" is extremely simplistic, and counter to thousands of years of storytelling), but it's not what Baymax was made for. In the aftermath, when Hiro is still feeling low and he tries to access Baymax's chip port again, Baymax prevents it and, instead, shows Hiro an archived video of Tadachi. It shows that Baymax does have some agency.
* The climax is suitably exciting and action-packed, and I like Hiro's alternative plan for victory; never mind getting the mask, just smash all the microbots until Callaghan runs out of them. The inside of the portal realm looks good, and Baymax sacrificing himself to get Hiro and Abigail out is the emotional climax. (Fortunately, Baymax doesn't stay gone. That would have made the movie much sadder.)
* Frankly, I don't understand why Callaghan looks so glum when he's being bundled into the back of the police car. For him, the result of all this exceeds his wildest dreams. He got his daughter back. She's alive and well. He came here for revenge, and he was reunited with his daughter instead. He ought to be pleased. Of course, as I observed previously, I don't think Callaghan is characterized very well in general.
* And since *Big Hero 6* is, at its core, a Marvel movie, stick around after the credits for a cameo from Stan Lee!

**In Conclusion**

*Big Hero 6* isn't exactly one of the greats, and it's a bit simplistic, but it's a fun superhero adventure with some nice aesthetics and a touch of that Pixar-esque heart. Solidly good.

Disney should now release all of the original movies and series they removed from Disney+ on physical media,"Now that Disney is making the remarkable decision to begin releasing its biggest Disney+ original series from Marvel & Star Wars on physical media, I think it is very important that the Disney+ original movies & tv series that were completely removed from the service get physical releases like this as well. 

As of right now there is no legal way to watch upwards of 76 movies & series that were exclusively made for the service. They have effectively removed all of the artists work from the face of the earth! Most of these had 4K releases on Disney+, but if Disney is concerned about spending a lot to release 4K Ultra HD copies of these movies and series, they should at the very least release them on Blu-Ray & DVD.

Will they all sell as well as the Marvel and Star Wars releases? No. But to at least having them AVAILABLE to watch is incredibly important to ensure that these productions are not erased from existence and to preserve them for future generations. 

What do you think about this?

This is the list of original movies and documentaries that were made for Disney+ that have been removed from the service since June:

- Artemis Fowl
- Better Nate Than Never

"Your thoughts on ""Frozen"" (2013)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

If there was any doubt remaining – after *The Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, and *Wreck-It Ralph* – that WDAS was back at the top of their game, *Frozen* must have obliterated it. With its resonant story, likable characters, and spectacular music, *Frozen* became a worldwide phenomenon, as any parent to a young child at the time would be able to attest. It made over a billion dollars at the box office (it held the record for highest-grossing animated film until 2019's *The Lion King*) and was the first WDAS movie to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

**Point by Point**

* Opening on the men harvesting the blocks of ice is an interesting choice. It doesn't really have anything to do with the story (aside from introducing us briefly to young Kristoff and Sven), but it gets us thinking about ice. Ice; it's beautiful and dangerous. Beware the frozen heart!
* Young Elsa and Anna are cute kids, and the snow and ice effects are magnificent, as they are throughout the movie. The king and queen mean well, but they fail Elsa badly. Even after the troll chief tells them that fear will be Elsa's enemy, her parents grab onto their fear with both hands and clasp it tight. They don't teach her to control her power, they teach her to hate and fear it. They teach her to hate and fear *herself*. I'm not a parent, so I can't presume to know how I'd react in a situation like this, but, from a detached perspective, the king and queen handle everything incorrectly from the start. (And what's up with those shackles we see Elsa wearing later in her cell? Her parents must have had those made for her and ready to be used. How messed up is that?)
* The story and themes of *Frozen* wouldn't be worth much without a good cast of characters. Of course, the film succeeds in that department as well. Elsa and Anna are both interesting and compelling, and Kristoff and Sven, when they show up, bring a good dynamic to the proceedings. Olaf is not only a brilliant and sympathetic font of comic relief, he's also a perfect demonstrator of Elsa's immense power. Not only has she plunged the entire region into an endless winter, but she's out here creating sentient life without even meaning to!
* *Frozen* is celebrated for its soundtrack, but 'Let It Go', now that's the showstopper; that whole sequence – with the creation of the ice palace and the triumphal change in Elsa's demeanor and appearance – is the highlight of the film right there. There's no doubt it's one of the greatest songs in the WDAS canon.
* After some fun adventures on the way to the ice palace, Anna confronting Elsa in the tower is dramatic and emotional. With Elsa declaring that she has to live a hermit's life, and the dueling singing between she and Anna, and then accidentally blasting Anna in the heart when she once again gives in to her fear and anxiety, it's probably my second-favorite part of the movie (behind the 'Let It Go' sequence).
* The scene with the trolls (and the song 'Fixer Upper') is a good diversion, and does some of the necessary work to get Anna and Kristoff closer to each other. Hans' heel turn might seem to come out of nowhere, although you can definitely pick up on some very subtle hints if you know it's coming. He's a villain, but he's not really *the* villain here. The real antagonist is Elsa's fear and her inability to control her powers; Hans merely takes advantage of all of that. Still, I think his role as would-be usurper is necessary, if only because it gives Anna a chance to sacrifice herself for Elsa, which she does in spectacular fashion.
* The climax on the frozen lake, with the blizzard raging all around, is exciting spectacle, with the best part being when Anna has to make the choice between running towards Kristoff to save herself or running towards Elsa, and chooses Elsa. What follows is perhaps the best subversion of the 'true love's kiss' trope, with Anna's ultimate sacrifice proving to be the act of true love required to break her curse.

**In Conclusion**

With its comparatively complex characters and story, and its magnificent visuals and music, *Frozen* deserves its popularity and prestige. It doesn't quite hit the same heights for me as the best Disney Renaissance movies (and that's probably only because I didn't grow up with it), but, of all the WDAS movies to have rolled out of the studio since *Tarzan*, it definitely comes the closest. My first thought was to file it under Great, but I have to ask myself, am I being nostalgia-biased? If I had been a child when *Frozen* came out, and if I had grown up with it, would I consider it a top tier Disney movie, worthy of standing alongside *The Little Mermaid* and *Beauty and the Beast*? Almost certainly. So, I'm going to make an allowance for my old fogeyness and let *Frozen* have a place at the top, where it most likely belongs.

"Your thoughts on ""Wreck-It Ralph"" (2012)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/naea0ubcktib1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dff7b52e818e01b92135bc817816ac022774de8

**Overview**

Using the medium of video games, *Wreck-It Ralph* explores what happens when the assigned villain of a narrative decides he doesn't want to be the villain anymore. Feeling insecure and discontented after thirty years of playing the heavy, Ralph sets out on a quest to change his destiny and gain the respect he craves.

**Point by Point**

* As in *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* and *Toy Story*, the filmmakers here were able to sprinkle in a generous assortment of licensed characters amongst the original cast, and, within the first few minutes, we're treated to cameo appearances by several video game icons. There's Bowser and Dr. Eggman; M. Bison and Zangief; Pac-Man and Q\*Bert and Frogger, among many others. There's no question this background population of recognizable characters makes *Wreck-It Ralph* that much more fun.
* It really is pretty shabby to throw a party for the thirtieth anniversary of *Fix-It Felix Jr.* and not invite Ralph. I mean, I get it, he's a big, clumsy guy, but you could have had the party outside.
* Determined to win a medal and prove he has what it takes to be a hero, Ralph infiltrates a first-person shooter called *Hero's Duty*, and is immediately overwhelmed by how “violent and scary” it is. We become more familiarized with the concept of video game characters as performers as we watch Sergeant Calhoun engage dramatically with the player, represented in-game by a drone equipped with a monitor. It's a neat concept.
* The world of kart racing game *Sugar Rush* (where Ralph ultimately ends up) is extremely well done; colorful and very attractive to look at, with everything made out of candy, cookies, and cake. Disney could have made a whole movie based on this premise alone. King Candy is a conscious homage to Ed Wynn, who, among many other things, provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in *Alice in Wonderland*.
* Ralph and Vanellope play off of each other well, although I didn't really sense quite the winning chemistry between them that the best Disney duos enjoy. The climactic race through the diverse environments of *Sugar Rush* is fun and exciting, and the stakes only heighten when the Cy-Bugs from *Hero's Duty* invade. King Candy turning out to be the demented Turbo in disguise is a good twist. In the end, Ralph uses his knack for destruction to save the day. In embracing who he is and what he's meant to be, he becomes the hero.

**In Conclusion**

I've been a video game enthusiast since the early 1990s, so I enjoyed the many cameos and references to real-life games. I couldn't get super invested in the story or the characters, however; it was fine, just nothing that really pulled me in. I enjoyed *Wreck-It Ralph* while I was watching it, but it just doesn't have that wow factor for me.

Is Star vs The Forces of Evil worth watching?,"I recently watched through Owl House and Amphibia (both phenomenal shows I can easily recommend) and when it comes to Disney cartoons this is one Im always iffy on checking out. 

I saw the first season and some of season 2 way long ago before season 3 started and thought it was fine. But I’ve never really had an itch to revisit and a big part of that is because of its reputation.

The best way I can describe it is if people say it’s a good show I’ve never heard why they consider it good. I’ve only ever hear people complaining about it. It’s not like Steven Universe where it has a large fandom that loves the show as well as a large hatedom. It’s only people complaining about it whether they liked it in the first place or not (from my perspective). Specifically when season 3 was coming out and season 4 only added fuel to the fire. I know shipping was a big part of that and I already know how that specifically ends because the official Disney YouTube channel spoiled for me when it happened.

"Your thoughts on ""Winnie the Pooh"" (2011)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

A Disney mainstay for decades, the Winnie the Pooh franchise saw a huge surge in popularity in the late 1990s with the release of the direct-to-video movie *Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin*. A slew of additional movies and TV specials followed (including *The Tigger Movie*, *Piglet's Big Movie*, and *Pooh's Heffalump Movie*, all of which received theatrical releases). With so much animated Pooh material out there, perhaps Walt Disney Animation Studios' own 2011 effort, titled simply *Winnie the Pooh*, failed to stand out. At any rate it received critical praise, but underperformed commercially. As of the present day, it's the last traditionally animated film to be produced by WDAS.

**Point by Point**

* The film opens nostalgically, with a reimagining of the look at Christopher Robin's room and the bouncy theme song featured in *The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. Like its forebear (no pun intended), *Winnie the Pooh* uses the storybook format; the narrator (John Cleese) converses with the characters, and the words on the pages become part of the action.
* The narrative takes direct inspiration from the stories of A.A. Milne; Pooh and his friends search for a new tail for Eeyore, and make plans to rescue Christopher Robin from an imagined monster. It's all very wholesome and good-natured, just as one would expect. The visual highlight of the piece comes when Pooh becomes so delirious with hunger that he imagines himself swimming in a sea of honey.
* There's nothing wrong, per se, with *Winnie the Pooh*. It's a perfectly adequate installment in the franchise. Nothing about it stands out, however; nothing about it suggests to me that it had to be a feature film produced by WDAS when it could have been a direct-to-DVD offering from one of the lesser studios. The story is just fluff, and none of the songs are the least bit memorable. And, at only sixty-three minutes, it's short.

**In Conclusion**

Of course, as an adult, I hardly represent the film's target audience. While most other movies in the WDAS canon manage to cater to broader demographics, *Winnie the Pooh* is decidedly for young children. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I do have to file it under the bottom tier of my personal ranking, however; even as a fan of Pooh in my childhood, this film simply didn't resonate with me. Again, not because it's bad, but simply because it isn't meant for me.

**Overview**

*Tangled*, Disney's long overdue adaptation of “Rapunzel”, marks the point where things really started to go right for Walt Disney Animation Studios again. It was in production for six years (it took them that long to get the hair looking right), and, to this day, is still the most expensive animated film ever produced. It was a critical and commercial success, however (which hadn't really happened for WDAS since *Lilo & Stitch*), and set Disney on the path to a new and brighter era.

**Point by Point**

* Though *Tangled* uses computer-animated graphics, the animators were keen to evoke the “warmth and intuitive feel” of Disney's classic, traditionally animated movies. The visuals are amazing; warm, bright, colorful, and full of light. Up until this more focused viewing of *Tangled*, I had never really appreciated how beautiful a movie in the computer-animated style could look. I had always thought of every movie done in this style – whether it be *Toy Story*, *Shrek*, or *Madagascar* – to look essentially the same. But now I can see that's not true at all. *Tangled* has taught me that a computer-animated film can look every bit as lush and magnificent as a traditionally animated masterpiece like *Beauty and the Beast* or *The Lion King*.
* As is usual for a Disney princess, Rapunzel captures my heart almost immediately. She's endearing, sympathetic, and bursting at the seams with hidden strength. Her long, long, *long* hair looks tremendous; it may have been an arduous labor, but the animators got it right. I love how it almost takes on a life of its own, and how Rapunzel can wield it as though it's a set of extra limbs; it doesn't get in her way or trip her up at all. She is its master.
* Mother Gothel is an inspired villain, representative of a subtle, insidious evil; the kind of evil that seems to love you and care for you, but only so far as it can use you to get what it wants. Gothel keeps Rapunzel in her place with gaslighting and emotional abuse, and, when she seems to do something nice for Rapunzel, it's only to keep her satiated and quiet. (Incidentally, how does Rapunzel know when her birthday is? The only possible explanation is that Gothel told her, but why would she do that?)
* Seeing Rapunzel experience being outside for the first time, after living her whole life as a shut-in, is an invigorating moment. That she also feels guilty about disobeying Gothel is a good bit of character exploration for her.
* Flynn takes Rapunzel to a tavern full of thugs and ruffians in an attempt to scare her off of her quest, but, as is her power as a Disney princess, she effortlessly charms the lot of them, and the song 'I've Got a Dream' is a catchy one. The action during the escape from the tavern is exciting, and Rapunzel using her hair's glowing properties to light their way out of the dark, flooded cavern is clever.
* Rapunzel and Flynn visiting the town during the festival is a good sequence. The little girls braiding Rapunzel's hair up for her is a cute moment, and the dance segment is joyful and energetic. The flying lanterns look really, really great; one of the most visually impressive moments in a Disney animated movie in a long time. And, as far as mood goes, I'd say that moment with Rapunzel and Flynn in the boat together is on a par with 'Kiss the Girl' from *The Little Mermaid*.
* Gothel's plan to gaslight Rapunzel back into her arms and win her everlasting trust and gratitude leads to the requisite “all is lost” moment, with Rapunzel back in her tower and Flynn awaiting the gallows. The way that Rapunzel comes to the realization of her true identity is a bit tenuous, but dramatic nonetheless. It all leads up to the climactic scene in the tower, where Flynn sacrifices his life to secure Rapunzel's freedom, and cuts her hair off. Gothel turns to dust, as she should have done ages ago.
* But wait! It looks as though not all of Rapunzel's healing powers were tied up in her hair. In what is surely a nod to the original Grimm tale, her tears bring Flynn back to life. Rapunzel returns to her parents and her throne, and all is well!

**In Conclusion**

The return to form for WDAS that began with *The Princess and the Frog* culminates with *Tangled*. Go figure that it would take a couple of princess movies to get Disney back on track; princess movies have always been their forte, after all. Welcome back, Disney, we missed you.

Disney Plus ended the Streaming Wars. We lost. The End.,"Excerpts from the article.

The more than 20% hike in prices means Disney+ will now cost twice the original price when the service debuted four years ago, and Hulu’s ad-free tier is now more expensive than the most popular Netflix plan.

Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCU and even Netflix have all raised prices this year in a drive toward profitability. And as Iger announced Wednesday for Disney, password-sharing crackdowns are also en route.

The announcement puts to an end much of the initial allure that led to the popularity of streaming. When Netflix first offered its pioneering service for only $8 a month, millions of people signed up, eager to have access to the company’s expansive catalog for just a fraction of the cost of the traditional cable bundle. That served as the genesis of the streaming era, with legacy entertainment companies such as Disney racing to launch their own direct-to-consumer products at unsustainably low costs.

Now that is all over.

Those massive libraries of content are growing more expensive (not to mention shrinking) by the year. In fact, consumers who bundle just a few streamers together in 2023 will find that the final cost is effectively the same as basic cable. Couple that reality with the introduction of ads into streaming and the end product eerily resembles on-demand cable.

It’s an ironic end to the streaming wars. After pouring billions and billions of dollars into constructing supposedly revolutionary streaming platforms, and decimating the business models that had offered the industry stability for decades, the ultimate product looks awfully similar to what companies and consumers were trying to break free from in the first place.

Can someone explain to me why many series are missing new seasons?,"There are a few series that are missing newer seasons and have been for years.  
The ones I noticed are the ducktales reboot (season 3 was missing for \~2 years), The Owl House (season 3 is missing) and Amphibia (seasons 2 and 3 are missing), but I'm sure there are more examples.  
It's like these seasons don't exist. (the on page season count excludes them)

And I simply cannot understand why. It's obviously some kind of region locking, since they are listed on US Disney+, but for me it just doesn't make sense. Region locking for streaming services like netflix is still stupid, but it makes sense, since netflix only licenses other media. But disney owns these series, so licensing can't be the reason. I can't see a single reason for disney to not show these seasons in my region, the only possible consequences are that less people watch them, or that they try to circumvent disney to watch them anyways.

"Your thoughts on ""Bolt"" (2008)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9k4y1es58ugb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=599f3c3966172afc5629ec56d1adcdae0b615651

**Overview**

*Bolt* isn't quite Disney at the top of its game, but it's definitely an indicator of even greater quality to come in the ensuing years; it's the dividing line between a dysfunctional and unremarkable past (*Home on the Range*, *Chicken Little*, *Meet the Robinsons*) and a brighter, more hopeful future (*The Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, *Frozen*). Overseen by John Lasseter, who had just been brought over from Pixar, *Bolt*'s box office was nothing to write home about, but it garnered mostly positive reviews, which, in itself, was something Walt Disney Animation Studios had been missing of late.

**Point by Point**

* Bolt is cute throughout the film; as a puppy he's *super* cute. We see him playing happily with his squeaky carrot toy when Penny comes in to adopt him. Five years later, Penny and Bolt are the stars of an action TV series! Thanks to the producer's avant-garde approach to character motivation, Bolt thinks it's all real, and that he really does possess super powers like super strength, super speed, heat vision, and a “super bark”. The destructive, action-packed chase through the streets of Los Angeles is a lively way to open the movie and introduce the concept, and, if you're unfamiliar with *Bolt*, then Disney has succeeded in tricking you too; you're going to get a movie much different than the one suggested by this intro.
* Sadly, because Bolt is meant to think that it's all real, he doesn't get to live the life of an ordinary dog. He doesn't get to relax and have fun. He's always anxious and on edge, always on guard against the bad guys who could be coming for Penny. (My nervous little guy freaks out every time someone walks past our apartment. I feel bad for Bolt having to live in that headspace *all* the time.) Penny doesn't even get to take him home with her; he has to live in a trailer on set. It's quite sad.
* Of course, the producer decides to film a two-parter that ends on a cliffhanger, with Penny in the clutches of the evildoers. This leaves Bolt frantic, and he doesn't intend to wait around to film the second half. He needs to rescue Penny *now*! In his attempt to escape the studio, however, he ends up falling into a shipping box and being rushed clear across the country to New York. Here he meets Mittens, a stray cat who's been running a protection racket on some pigeons. As Bolt is convinced Mittens is involved with Penny's kidnapping, she becomes involved in his quixotic trek back to Hollywood.
* It's fun to watch Mittens freak out while Bolt continuously tries to do “super” things like jump onto a speeding train or melt a padlock by staring at it. Eventually, however, Bolt comes to the tough realization that his powers are just Hollywood make-believe, and Mittens teaches him how to do normal dog things like begging for snacks and playing fetch. Along their way they meet up with a hamster (and super fan of Bolt) named Rhino, who provides additional comic relief. The song 'Barking at the Moon' is pleasant, if forgettable, and plays over a heartwarming montage of Bolt connecting with his inner dog as the trio travels across the country.
* Bolt finally makes it back to the studio, only to find himself replaced by a similar-looking dog. It wasn't Penny's idea; the showrunners insisted. To Bolt's eyes, however, it looks as though Penny's affection for him was as fake as his heat vision. It's a sad moment. Luckily, he doesn't labor under that illusion for long.
* Things escalate quickly after that. A fire breaks out in the studio and Penny is trapped. Bolt rushes in to save her. They try to get out, but Penny is overcome by the smoke and collapses. Bolt makes the decision to stay with her. Then he gets the idea to bark loudly through a vent, alerting the firefighters to their location. His “super” bark saves the day.
* Penny and Bolt retire from show business after this, and, in the Disney tradition of the family adopting the stray, Mittens gets to stay (and so does Rhino). The film closes out with a cute montage of Penny and the pets doing lots of fun things together.

**In Conclusion**

*Bolt* isn't particularly innovative or challenging, but it's a cute, heartwarming story, with lovable characters, and it feels like WDAS getting back on track after several post-Renaissance years of mediocrity. Particularly as a dog person, I liked it.

game but its definitely an indicator of even greater quality to come in the ensuing years its the dividing line between a dysfunctional and unremarkable past home on the range chicken little meet the robinsons and a brighter more hopeful future the princess and the frog tangled frozen overseen by john lasseter who had just been brought over from pixar bolts box office was nothing to write home about but it garnered mostly positive reviews which in itself was something walt disney animation studios had been missing of late point by point bolt is cute throughout the film as a puppy hes super cute we see him playing happily with his squeaky carrot toy when penny comes in to adopt him five years later penny and bolt are the stars of an action tv series thanks to the producers avantgarde approach to character motivation bolt thinks its all real and that he really does possess super powers like super strength super speed heat vision and a super bark the destructive actionpacked chase through the streets of los angeles is a lively way to open the movie and introduce the concept and if youre unfamiliar with bolt then disney has succeeded in tricking you too youre going to get a movie much different than the one suggested by this intro sadly because bolt is meant to think that its all real he doesnt get to live the life of an ordinary dog he doesnt get to relax and have fun hes always anxious and on edge always on guard against the bad guys who could be coming for penny my nervous little guy freaks out every time someone walks past our apartment i feel bad for bolt having to live in that headspace all the time penny doesnt even get to take him home with her he has to live in a trailer on set its quite sad of course the producer decides to film a twoparter that ends on a cliffhanger with penny in the clutches of the evildoers this leaves bolt frantic and he doesnt intend to wait around to film the second half he needs to rescue penny now in his attempt to escape the studio however he ends up falling into a shipping box and being rushed clear across the country to new york here he meets mittens a stray cat whos been running a protection racket on some pigeons as bolt is convinced mittens is involved with pennys kidnapping she becomes involved in his quixotic trek back to hollywood its fun to watch mittens freak out while bolt continuously tries to do super things like jump onto a speeding train or melt a padlock by staring at it eventually however bolt comes to the tough realization that his powers are just hollywood makebelieve and mittens teaches him how to do normal dog things like begging for snacks and playing fetch along their way they meet up with a hamster and super fan of bolt named rhino who provides additional comic relief the song barking at the moon is pleasant if forgettable and plays over a heartwarming montage of bolt connecting with his inner dog as the trio travels across the country bolt finally makes it back to the studio only to find himself replaced by a similarlooking dog it wasnt pennys idea the showrunners insisted to bolts eyes however it looks as though pennys affection for him was as fake as his heat vision its a sad moment luckily he doesnt labor under that illusion for long things escalate quickly after that a fire breaks out in the studio and penny is trapped bolt rushes in to save her they try to get out but penny is overcome by the smoke and collapses bolt makes the decision to stay with her then he gets the idea to bark loudly through a vent alerting the firefighters to their location his super bark saves the day penny and bolt retire from show business after this and in the disney tradition of the family adopting the stray mittens gets to stay and so does rhino the film closes out with a cute montage of penny and the pets doing lots of fun things together in conclusion bolt isnt particularly innovative or challenging but its a cute heartwarming story with lovable characters and

"Your thoughts on ""Meet the Robinsons"" (2007)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ja3duzp59gb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a0468fec7a0298a59227687fa6a96c2699f7119

**Overview**

Inspired very loosely by a children's book called *A Day With Wilbur Robinson* (to give you an idea of just how loosely, the book's story doesn't feature time travel at all), *Meet the Robinsons* is Disney's second fully computer animated film, following the commercial success of *Chicken Little*. Although WDAS had begun catering to more traditional visual trends in animation, *Meet the Robinsons* was a box office bomb, and is yet another Disney film of the 2000s relegated to obscurity.

**Point by Point**

* *Meet the Robinsons* focuses on an orphan named Lewis who also happens to be a brilliant inventor. After his latest invention destroys a science fair, he gets pulled into a time-twisting adventure and ends up meeting his future family - the titular Robinsons - in a society built on his inventions.
* *Meet the Robinsons* is a pleasant enough film, but not very remarkable. Lewis and Wilbur are both likable protagonists, but the story is a bit flat for a time travel adventure. The various members of the family Robinson are two-dimensional, and aren't given any time to shine. They're just set dressing. There's an octopus butler, a pair of twins who live in tree planters, and a superhero-themed pizza delivery guy voiced by Adam West, but none of them actually *do* anything. The twist - that Lewis is actually the patriarch of the Robinson clan - helps spice things up a little, but not much comes of it.
* Bowler Hat Guy has a good aesthetic going on; classic vaudeville, complete with black cape and twirly mustache. He's funny and colorful, but his partner in crime - an evil robot Lewis invents in the future - has zero personality. The revelation of Bowler Hat Guy's true identity is clever enough, but seems to come out of nowhere, with no prior hints or foreshadowing.
* Of course, everything wraps up well for everyone, and the ending is sweet and satisfying as Lewis' destiny comes full circle. It just feels like it ought to have more to it.

**In Conclusion**

I can understand why *Meet the Robinsons* failed to find an audience. It's not that it's bad, it's just...bland. There isn't a lot to it. The story and the characters have potential, but they simply never rise to the occasion. *Encanto*, years later, does a much more competent job of telling a story about a large, colorful family.

**Overview**

With an eye on the success of *The Lion King*, Michael Eisner put in an order for more naturalistic, animal-centered films. Needless to say, *Brother Bear* did not achieve the heights of that 1990s favorite; Walt Disney Animation Studios was still in the reeds at this point, struggling for relevance amidst more popular animated offerings from Pixar and DreamWorks. Like most WDAS films from this era, *Brother Bear* exists in relative obscurity today.

**Point by Point**

* As with most Disney animated movies, there's no denying that *Brother Bear* looks good, especially after Kenai has been turned into a bear and the backgrounds become consciously more colorful. The music is good too, although the return of Phil Collins sadly fails to recapture the lightning in a bottle that was the *Tarzan* soundtrack. The opening song (performed by Tina Turner) is sweeping and energetic enough to get the blood pumping, but the epic feel doesn't last.
* Kenai is irresponsible and not very likable at first, but, I mean, I get it. He wanted his totem to be strength or bravery or something manly like that, and then the old lady shaman tells him, in front of everybody, that his totem is love? I'd probably be disappointed too. As it turns out, Kenai has a lot to learn about love.
* The middle brother, Denahi, starts out with a more sensible perspective, if a tad unrelatable. (I freely admit that if my big brother had died saving me from being mauled by a bear, I'd be a lot less forgiving of said bear.) When he believes that Kenai has also fallen victim to the bear, however, he's fresh out of pacifism, and vows revenge.
* The bear cub, Koda, is cute and likable, and he and Kenai, during their journey to the salmon run, enjoy a dynamic similar to that of Shrek and Donkey. (Kenai is grumpy, and Koda won't shut the hell up.) The moose duo provides adequate comedy relief.
* It's a dramatic moment when both Kenai and the audience realize that the bear Kenai killed previously was, in fact, Koda's mother, and suddenly we're seeing the raging beast from earlier in a whole new light. Kenai's heartfelt confession to Koda feels a bit leaden, however, especially with the blandish Phil Collins song playing over it.
* The ending is pretty satisfying, with Kenai and Denahi reconciling, and Kenai electing to remain a bear for Koda's sake. I suppose this all shakes out all right because of the events that started it. If Koda's mother had initiated the aggression, then ending her would have been the right thing for Kenai to do. You don't need to feel guilty for protecting yourself and your family from a dangerous animal. All the bear did, however, was help herself to some fish that were freely on offer due to Kenai's negligence. Kenai's violent response was disproportionate, and led only to death and suffering. Now he's redeemed himself, and learned about love.

**In Conclusion**

I was nineteen in 2003, and didn't get around to watching *Brother Bear* until years later. As such, it dwells well outside the purview of my nostalgia. It's easy to be underwhelmed by a children's movie that wasn't part of your childhood. I fully acknowledge that I was not the target audience for this. Although it has its strengths (good visuals, mostly likable characters, a story with a moral), it's decidedly mediocre.

**Overview**

The concept of ""*Treasure Island* in outer space"" had been kicking around Walt Disney Animation Studios for years; directors John Musker and Ron Clements had been pushing for it since the 1980s. Though the setting doesn't do much to enhance the story (pretty much everything that happens in space in the movie could have happened just as easily on the high seas), the fanciful juxtaposition of tall sailing ships against the stars (and the period dress worn by the characters) creates an aesthetic not dissimilar to steampunk. Unfortunately, *Treasure Planet* was a giant bomb at the box office (it had to compete with Harry Potter, James Bond, and *The Santa Clause 2*), but, like *Atlantis*, it has since gained a greater appreciation among Disney fans.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals, as usual, are impressive. The animators set out to make a sci fi film with warm overtones, rather than dark and sterile and metallic, and I'd say they succeeded. The ships are made of wood, the solar powered sails are full of sunlight, and the outer space scenery is colorful, and characterized by bright, striking phenomena like comets and star storms. The characters themselves look good too, and cover a broad range of alien designs.
* Jim's skysurfing scene at the beginning is visceral and exciting, and is a good introduction to Jim's character. He's a problem child who's failing in school and frequently in trouble with the law. He wants to do better, though, especially for his mother's sake. Delbert is a good foil for Jim; a more responsible and grounded character to play off of.
* Of course, getting Long John Silver right is a key part of any *Treasure Island* adaptation. If you whiff on that, you might as well chuck the whole project. Luckily, this version of Silver - a charismatic cyborg with a multipurpose Roto-Rooter for a cybernetic arm - fills the role well. He's a likable  scoundrel who takes Jim under his wing and turns out to be more of a sympathetic rogue than an outright villain. His pet shapeshifter, Morph, provides the requisite sidekick antics.
* *Treasure Planet* really has only one song, but it's a great one. 'I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)' is a highlight of the film, and it has a place on my regular playlist. It plays over a montage that's partially flashbacks to Jim's early childhood and his father walking out on the family, and partially Silver teaching him how to be a sailor (or spacer, I suppose).
* The film slows down a bit in the third act, after arriving at Treasure Planet. I wouldn't say it gets boring, but it does drag its feet a bit. Things pick up again, however, once the characters discover Flint's enormous vault at the core of the planet; a terrific set piece. And there's Flint's cold remains, sitting at the center of it all, like a dead king. The loot of a thousand worlds, and what did he do with it? He stockpiled it here and then died counting it.
* And, of course, he rigged the whole thing to explode in case anyone found it; better to destroy it all than share it. Silver gets his moment of redemption when he gives up the treasure to save Jim's life, and their escape through the portal is an exciting climax. Of course, Silver goes free at the end, but not before giving Jim a handful of treasure with which to finance a better life for himself and his mother.

**In Conclusion**

*Treasure Planet* is a well-crafted adventure film, definitely one of the best Disney animated films of its era, and it deserved better than it got. It looks good, it's got a great song, and the characters are developed and voice acted well. The first decade of the twenty-first century was a rough one for WDAS, though. Children's animation was in the midst of a cultural flux, and contemporary films like *Shrek*, *Ice Age*, *Madagascar*, *Finding Nemo*, and *The Incredibles* were taking all the oxygen. We have a bit further to go yet before Disney would rediscover its footing. In the meantime, I'd place *Treasure Planet* solidly on my A tier.

**Overview**

Born out of a desire by Disney to produce something light and relatively inexpensive, *Lilo & Stitch* is a deceptively simple story about the meaning of family. Although it lacks the scale and production values of its contemporaries like *Dinosaur*, *The Emperor's New Groove*, and *Atlantis*, it became the most successful and probably most beloved Disney animated film of its era.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals of *Lilo & Stitch* are soft and appealing, using watercolor painted backgrounds, and suit the Hawaiian setting well. It gives the film a sort of soothing quality. The character designs are good too.
* Lilo is cute and funny, and she has a good dynamic with her sister Nani. They're both sympathetic and likable. Even Stitch is cute; I hadn't expected to find Stitch cute but, yeah, in the context of the movie, he's pretty lovable. He was created to be an agent of destruction, but he's also very smart. He can learn. Though he starts out just using Lilo to escape capture by his pursuers, he eventually gets to the point where he enjoys being part of the family. It's a sweet moment when he asks Lilo to take him out on the surfboard, despite his inability to swim or float.
* I won't lie. The moment where Stitch leaves the house with the Ugly Duckling storybook, and goes out into the woods to wait for a family to find him...that got me. That made me feel things.
* The fight at the house is a good action sequence (""Oh, good, the dog found a chainsaw!""), as is the finale where Stitch rescues Lilo from the shark-looking guy. Stitch's eloquent goodbye to Lilo and Nani after he's been captured is sweet, and demonstrates to the alien authorities that he's become civilized. The montage at the end, showing Lilo and Nani and Stitch (and also David and Bubbles and the aliens) doing lots of things together and being a family, is a really nice way to close it all out.

**In Conclusion**

I was in high school in the early 2000s, so we're well past the Disney movies that played their parts in my childhood. I'm much less familiar with the WDAS films of this era, and nostalgia no longer holds sway. As such, I really didn't expect to enjoy *Lilo & Stitch* as much as I did; I thought it would be kind of dumb and annoying; I thought Stitch would be like a Minion. But it's actually really well done, with likable characters and emotional moments. To my pleasant surprise, I'm filing it under Great.

**Overview**

The makers of *Atlantis* were passionate about their project, and a lot of care and effort went into it. (They even got the guy who invented the Klingon language for the Star Trek franchise to come in and create an Atlantean language.) It's a quality product, but it simply didn't resonate with audiences. Not only did it face stiff competition at the box office from *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider*, *Dr. Dolittle 2*, and *The Fast and the Furious*, but it had the misfortune of releasing a mere month after the smash hit *Shrek* had turned the business of animated movies on its head.

**Point by Point**

* The movie looks great, and has its own distinct style; more angular, lifelike but rugged, kind of comic bookish (which makes sense, as Mike Mignola, creator of Hellboy, was one of the production designers). It definitely carries an overall air of sci fi, and possibly even some Indiana Jones. The visuals may not appear as lush as those in *Aladdin*, *The Lion King*, or *Tarzan*, but I'd still say the film looks every bit as good as any of Disney's 1990s efforts.
* The characters are fleshed out, interesting, and mostly likable. There's a whole sequence during the expedition where the explorers settle down to camp, and they take the time to elaborate on their motivations and their personal histories. This isn't something you'd normally see in a Disney animated movie, at least not outside the context of an elaborate musical number.
* Speaking of things you wouldn't normally see in a Disney animated movie, how about that encounter with the Leviathan? The explorers' party starts out about two hundred strong, and then that thing comes along on the very first leg of the journey and just wipes out ninety percent of them! Good thing we didn't learn any of their names; that would have been time completely wasted.
* Atlantis looks magnificent, of course, and it's too bad Kida never got to be inducted into the heavily merchandised line of Disney princesses. Milo is a likable hero, and the supporting protagonists - the fast-talking Sweet, the tough tomboy Audrey, and the explosives-obsessed Vinny - are good too. Rourke makes a suitably slimy antagonist; the type who's probably crazy on the inside.
* All in all, *Atlantis* isn't really targeted at young children. There's no songs, there's very little comedy relief, the pacing is much slower, and there's hardly any action to speak of until the finale (which is quite good). Some concepts will also fly over the heads of little kids; even I didn't know what was going on one hundred percent of the time. Unfortunately for Disney, the older kids who might have benefitted from this more serious adventure story were getting their heads turned by Shrek and Lara Croft instead.

**In Conclusion**

*Atlantis* is an admirable effort by Disney to turn out a sci fi adventure film that plays things mostly straight, but it came along at the wrong cultural moment. As noted above, *Shrek* had seized the zeitgeist, and traditional animation was falling by the wayside anyway. Though it languished in relative obscurity for years and was generally viewed by all as a misfire, *Atlantis* has been enjoying some burgeoning reputation in recent times, which it deserves. It's not great, but it's good.

"Your thoughts on ""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ey9krhanxcdb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1da9619ec94c851b11e1952d69ce99951400ef4b

**Overview**

*The Emperor's New Groove* was originally conceived as a more dramatic adventure set against a backdrop of Inca culture and mythology, to be called *Kingdom of the Sun*. Disney had noticed, however, that their funny movies had historically made more money than their more serious ones, and so ultimately switched gears and dialed up the comedy (and eliminated just about every reference to the real life Inca). Released shortly before *Shrek*, *The Emperor's New Groove* was a forebear of what would become a hot trend in children's animated movies during the 2000s; edgier, self-aware humor.

**Point by Point**

* *The Emperor's New Groove* has remarkably little to it. It's an enjoyable film, primarily because it parlays its comedy so well. The story is paper thin, and I found it difficult to care about the protagonists. Kuzco is patently unlikable for most of the film's running time, and Pacha is just kind of boring. (Pacha's kids are funny, though, especially when they're messing with Yzma.) Overall, I really do think the movie could have benefitted from some elaborate and lively musical numbers.
* The villainous Yzma and her dim-witted boy toy Kronk steal the show; the movie is definitely at its best when one or both of them are onscreen, and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton both give great performances. Kitt's performance as a maniacal kitten during the climax is particularly entertaining. (Of course, Kitt was famous for playing Catwoman on TV's *Batman*. I don't know if that's a deliberate nod, or just a coincidence.)

**In Conclusion**

Yeah, so, that's *The Emperor's New Groove*, I guess. I wish I had more to say about it. Good visuals, good voice acting, good comedy; not particularly memorable. It's pure fluff, but enjoyable fluff.

When will Disney release a middle east version of D+ on Windows ?,"Hello, I've been a subscriber to Disney+ since almost the first day it released in Egypt, since release there was no app for middle east viewers \*on windows\*, and there still isn't, is there any news/upcoming release date on when or if it there is going to be ?

why does it matter though ? for me at least

I only have a phone and a laptop, (besides the fact that my phone's screen is 720p), my laptop's screen is a beautiful 1080p OLED, and it frustrates me that i can't watch D+ content at 1080p on my laptop, i can only access it through the website, which for ""security reasons"" only goes up to 720p, the windows app doesn't work in the middle east region, it just says ""not available in your region"" when you open it

Funny enough the mobile version is different from say the US version, its a separate app for the middle east region, why can't they do this on desktop !

So for middle east viewers, not just myself, if i wanted to watch my content at 1080p id have to have a phone/tablet that supports this resolution or a smart TV so this isn't just my issue, I'm sure most people would like to watch D+ on their computers/laptops in FHD, is there any hope of a middle east windows version ?",3,0.71,5,agressive_wc_flusher,:Question: Question,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1689944086.0,False,False,False,2023-07-21 12:54:46,hello ive been a subscriber to disney since almost the first day it released in egypt since release there was no app for middle east viewers on windows and there still isnt is there any newsupcoming release date on when or if it there is going to be why does it matter though for me at least i only have a phone and a laptop besides the fact that my phones screen is p my laptops screen is a beautiful p oled and it frustrates me that i cant watch d content at p on my laptop i can only access it through the website which for security reasons only goes up to p the windows app doesnt work in the middle east region it just says not available in your region when you open it funny enough the mobile version is different from say the us version its a separate app for the middle east region why cant they do this on desktop so for middle east viewers not just myself if i wanted to watch my content at p id have to have a phonetablet that supports this resolution or a smart tv so this isnt just my issue im sure most people would like to watch d on their computerslaptops in fhd is there any hope of a middle east windows version,when will disney release a middle east version of d on windows,1

Bringing back older Disney shows,"I know by the title it may seem as if I'm asking for reboots, which I'm not ( even though that doesn't sound that bad), but I think there was something different in the older Disney shows. I mean nowadays there's barely anyone watching Disney ( at least the Disney series that are airing currently). Disney channel is recommended for ages 7-17, and do you know who's actually watching the shows? Eight year olds to ten year olds. But when the other Disney shows aired ( Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Lab Rats, Mighty Med, Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place) 7-17 year olds were actually watching Disney. If you're wondering about how I know this, I was a teenager in the mid 2000's. And now I nanny three kids. Those three kids would rather be watching shameless than Disney channel. Now this is where the problem comes in, kids in this generation shouldn't be watching adult shows, but Disney channel isn't fun for them anymore. To test out my theory that older Disney is better than newer Disney, I showed my kids the shows I used to watch. They are completely obsessed with Mighty Med and Hannah Montana now. When I was growing up you could watch Disney channel with your parents, mostly because of the jokes that flew over the kid's heads that the parents understood. But I've noticed how the dialogue and humour has now been dumbed down. When I have kids, I want them growing up with the Disney I had, not the new one. Before I end this post, i just want to share that in 2014 Disney had an average of two million daily viewers, and in 2022 they had just around 180 thousand. I could genuinely write a lot more about this, but I'll spare you.

Secret Invasion finale = Agents Of SHIELD return?,"I think that the Agents Of SHIELD will be officially returning to the MCU next week in the finale for Secret Invasion, and here is my evidence for my theory...

- Kevin Feige and others have confirmed that AOS *is still part of the MCU* (but has admittedly not confirmed they will be returning)
- The Marvel official website's biography of the MCU version of Nick Fury mentions AOS multiple times. It says nothing about the team and events in the show no longer being canon, or taking place in a different part of the multiverse. 
- AOS has been moved from the ""Marcel Legacies"" collection on Disney+, where all the non-canon stuff is (such as Inhumans, The Gifted or Legion) 
- When the first episode of Secret Invasion aired, the ""Featured""/""Showcase"" area of Disney+ had that show front-and-center... With AOS being the second thing on the list! Now why might that be, I wonder?.. 
- Chloe Bennet - aka ""Quake""/Daisy - did a social media video where she very passionately states that she is *not* going to be in Secret Invasion... Now, lots of characters have been speculated to be returning, lots of fans have been asking the actors if they are going to be in the show...

"Secret Invasion: a wasted opportunity, and an abandoned one at that...","#Intro
Hello, everyone!
Okay, so this will be a *generally* spoiler-free little ""take"", from a serious MCU nerd who also knows the source material. 

(By ""generally"" I mean that there is the assumption that you know the general plot synopsis, are aware of what skrulls are, their abilities, and their relationships with the other characters, etc. Stuff like that. So, with that in-mind, let's get into it...)

# ""A wasted opportunity""
So, the concept of a secret alien invasion where they can look like us is a brilliant one. It could be a great ""whodunit?"" where absolutely *anyone* could be an alien in disguise. Now, I know there is still one episode to go, but five episodes in, I'm *vastly* underwhelmed. It's had its moments of brilliance, of course. But there is absolutely no way in heckadoodle they are going to fulfill the premise's potential in *one* episode... Let me list some things I think are missing, here.

+ You cannot trust *anyone*. Even Nick Fury! As far as we know, there is no way to tell that a person is human (and not a skrull) except for injuring their flesh, which causes them to reveal themselves, just slightly, or if they die, when they transform completely. So why oh why oh why are our protagonists just casually meeting-up and doing *nothing* to confirm their identities?! They need to be cutting themselves even just a little bit, or heck, just a code phrase! There is *no caution whatsoever* when in this setup they need to be *overly* cautious! And there should *definitely* have been reveals that actually, that person isn't the protagonist after-all(!), to really lean-in to the mystery. 
+ The aliens could potentially disguise themselves *as other aliens* or at the very least as the other aliens' human disguises. *No one* has done this yet, five episodes in! Again, this would really up the stakes, increase the mystery, keep people guessing, etc.
+ Five episodes in, and we don't know why the antagonist is the way he is. He's angry at the humans - Fury in particular - but there's not even a little hint as to *why* . All we've got so far is that Fury hasn't found them a new home, like he promised at the end of Captain Marvel. He *could* be a really cool villain who we might even empaphise with, like the one from Black Panther. But instead, he's just bad... Because... Neither he nor Fury have even explained why/how the skrulls haven't managed to find somewhere on earth yet. There are *tonnes* of places they could go. There's only one million of them, for goodness sake...
+ In the comics, there was this whole thing where there were heroes and villains who were revealed to actually be skrulls! Because the skrulls could copy powers, not just faces and memories. So, we had heroes/villains who we *thought* were dead who actually weren't and heroes/villains who returned from the dead after it was revealed they had been taken by their dopplegangers, for instance. It was a great way for Marvel to ""retcon"" stuff they'd done in the past few years, and it really did keep people guessing! We've *kind-of* seen a little bit of this in the TV show when they revealed in episode 4 that someone we thought was a protagonist we know and love is actually a skrull in disguise, leaving us to wonder ""how long have they been a skrull? Have they *always* been a skrull?!"" but again, it's a really, really underused concept.
+ Too. Few. Episodes. Six episodes just isn't enough, simple as that! This *should* be an *epic* event spanning many, many more episodes, with tonnes more mysteries, fan theories, reveals, etc.
+ Why wasn't *this* ""phase four""? Let's be honest here, folks, I think most of us agree that phase 4 was a bit ""meh"", to-say-the-least. But Secret Invasion would have been *awesome*!!! We could have - *should* have - had the phase 4 movies have tiny little ""Easter eggs"", reveals, post-credits stuff etc leading-up to a big Avengers movie, ala The Infinity Saga. But nope, we get six episodes of TV, and a farely underwhelming ""phase"" instead :-( 

#Abandonment issues...
So, a *huge* number of MCU fans don't actually know this show even *exists* or are aware of it, but not that it's airing. Why? Little-to-no advertising!

For goodness sake, they don't even put Secret Invasion as the first thing on the ""Featured"" every week! And the thumbnail (little image) in the menus that you scroll through to pick what you want, it *doesn't even look like an MCU show* . It looks more like a spy show or something!

No wonder the viewership is so blasted low!

"Your thoughts on ""Fantasia 2000"" (1999)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Walt Disney had originally conceived *Fantasia* as an ongoing project, which could be rereleased in perpetuity with new segments added to the mix each time. Obviously, this never panned out. In fact, *Fantasia* was a bit of a boondoggle, and didn't actually begin to make a profit until 1969, after several rereleases. The film enjoyed great commercial success upon its initial home video release in 1991, however, and sales convinced then CEO Michael Eisner that a follow-up could be viable. Thus, *Fantasia 2000* was born, following in the same model as its forebear.

**Point by Point**

* With little preamble, *Fantasia 2000* opens almost immediately onto an energetic and colorful sequence of geometric shapes behaving like butterflies and bats, set to part of Beethoven's 'Symphony No. Five'. It does a good job of setting the tone; whereas the original *Fantasia* opened with a more lilting and cerebral sequence set to Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D minor', this new iteration of *Fantasia* is faster paced and more bombastic.
* *Pines of Rome* shows us a bunch of humpback whales that can glide through the air as easily as they can underwater. It goes on a bit, but it's pretty, and it builds to an exciting finale full of thunder and lightning that sees the whales apparently bursting through the mythical firmament above the Earth and surfacing in outer space.
* *Rhapsody in Blue*, following the lives of four different characters in 1930s New York, is one of the more engaging segments, probably because of its strong, cohesive narrative. The segment immediately following, inspired loosely by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"", is good too. *The Carnival of the Animals* is brief, but fun.
* After a reiteration of *The Sorcerer's Apprentice*, Donald Duck gets his turn with *Pomp and Circumstance*. It's a pleasant bit of fluff, but nowhere near as epic or as legendary as Mickey's contribution.
* *Firebird Suite*, with its impressive visuals and its themes of destruction and rebirth, is a good one to go out on.

**In Conclusion**

There's no avoiding the fact that audiences had changed since the release of the original *Fantasia* in 1940. People back then were much more susceptible to awe and wonder when it came to animation. Entertainment and technology were both much simpler. Fast forward sixty years, however, and Disney wants to introduce the concept of *Fantasia* to generations of people who have grown up on TV, video games, rock n' roll, and Disney's own frenetic films like *Aladdin* and *The Lion King*. Though *Fantasia 2000* adheres to the model of its forebear, it was obvious to me during my viewing that the segments, in general, were faster, livelier, and far less abstract. (And the overall runtime is shorter by almost an hour.) All in all, I'd say Disney did an impressive job of retaining the heart and soul of *Fantasia* while tempering it to fit modern sensibilities.

As much as I respect *Fantasia* for what it is (and I really do respect it), you'll have noticed that I relegate it to the bottom tier in my personal ranking. The format just isn't my cup of tea; I'm not into it. I think I can just about justify placing *Fantasia 2000* in Tier B, however. Though I'm not much likelier to sit down and watch it again for fun, I do appreciate the aesthetic improvements Disney made to the format to make it more digestible.

**Overview**

Tarzan has been an iconic character for over a century now, but, unless you're old enough to remember the series of B movies starring Johnny Weissmuller, chances are Disney's *Tarzan* is the version you're most familiar with. And that's no bad thing. Dozens of Tarzan movies have been released over the decades, dating all the way back to the silent era, but I think Disney's *Tarzan* is likely the best of them all. With Walt Disney Animation Studios at the height of its creative powers, *Tarzan* manages to capture and convey the essence of the character and his world more ably than a nude bodybuilder on a 1930s soundstage could.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals and animation are gorgeous, and I think the medium of animation suits Tarzan extremely well. The way he surfs through the trees and swings from vines with both his hands and feet would be impossible to replicate in live-action. Likewise, his relationship with the gorillas is best depicted in typical Disney fashion (with the gorillas able to speak and emote). The music, too, is exemplary, with Phil Collins performing the songs as part of the narrative, rather than the characters singing themselves.
* The dramatic opening, with Collins singing 'Two Worlds', sets the tone right away for drama and excitement. Tarzan's shipwrecked parents arrive in the jungle and build their treehouse; Kerchak and Kala lose their baby to a leopard attack; Kala discovers the orphaned Tarzan and saves him from another leopard (or maybe the same one). It feels epic right off the bat.
* Young Tarzan has a hard time fitting in with the gorillas, but the 'Son of Man' (an invigorating and inspiring song) sequence shows him overcoming his weaknesses by embracing that which makes him different. Using his human ingenuity, he crafts tools like spears and lassos, and uses tricks to conquer his environment. This theme culminates with adult Tarzan's fight against the leopard. By saving Kerchak and slaying the leopard with the tip of a spear, he proves he's become a master of the jungle.
* Tarzan saving Jane from the angered baboons is a thrilling action sequence, followed immediately by his proper introduction to Jane and his meaningful realization that she's the same as he is. When young Tarzan compared his hands to Kala's hands earlier, he saw that they were similar, yet not alike. Now he touches his hand to Jane's, and he realizes, with awe, that creatures like him do exist.
* 'Strangers Like Me' is another great song set to a montage, this time of Tarzan learning about the human world. This and 'Son of Man' are both on my regular playlist.
* The scene where Kala shows Tarzan the treehouse where she found him is an emotional moment and handled well; essentially like a mother revealing to her child that he was adopted. Tarzan ultimately makes the choice to put on his father's old suit and go back to England with Jane.
* The climax - saving the gorillas from Clayton and his men - is exciting and action-packed, and Clayton gets the comeuppance he deserves. Tarzan and Kerchak finally have their moment, and Tarzan realizes he has to stay; not because he wouldn't be able to adjust to life in England, but because he must take his place as the new leader of the troop. Jane, of course, decides to stay with him. Two worlds, one family.

**In Conclusion**

The vaunted Disney Renaissance draws to a close with *Tarzan*, but what a film to go out on. With its visuals, music, and storytelling, I believe this just might be the definitive version of Tarzan, in the same way that so many other Disney adaptations have become the definitive versions of their own stories. A top-tier movie for sure.

"Your thoughts on ""Mulan"" (1998)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6muyr2e5wrbb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ac4e90c8207c57a4d29e67961ff1237391a4f28

**Overview**

Prior to 1998, few people outside of China had ever heard the name Mulan. In true Disney fashion, however, the filmmakers took what might have once been an esoteric Far Eastern legend and turned it into a globally popular story that stands as a pillar of the Disney Renaissance.

**Point by Point**

* As is to be expected from a Disney animated movie of this era, the visuals look great. Even though it's a noticeably different aesthetic from *Beauty and the Beast* or *The Lion King* \- inspired by Chinese watercolor - *Mulan* still looks every bit as good as its contemporaries.
* Mulan is immediately likable, and follows well in the tradition of strong Disney heroines like Ariel, Belle, and Pocahontas. She's surrounded by an excellent supporting cast; her family and her friends in the army are well-rounded and sympathetic, and Mushu provides sharp, observational comic relief. Even the mute Cricket serves a purpose by giving Mushu someone to riff to and play off of.
* Shan Yu, the Hun leader, is a dark, intimidating villain, but, as far as Disney antagonists go, he's one of the weakest. He's not really fleshed out at all, and, beyond being the guy who wants to kill the Emperor for some arbitrary reason, he isn't given much of a personality. To this day most people can't even recall the character's name. (I had to look it up.) But that's okay, because Shan Yu doesn't present the story's true obstacle. The real conflict of *Mulan* is the heroine's journey of self-discovery and determination, and her triumph in the face of adversity. That's the main point of all this here. Shan Yu presents merely a sinister monolith to be overcome once Mulan has come into herself.
* 'Reflection' is a good character song, giving us insight into Mulan's inner turmoil. The scene soon afterwards, where Mulan's father is given his conscription orders, is a dramatic one. He and the rest of the family all know it's his death warrant, and Mulan is keenly aware that things would be different if her parents had had a son instead. The sequence in which Mulan cuts her hair, takes her father's armor, and rides off into the night is done exceedingly well.
* 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' is a great song for a training montage. Notably, Mulan is given a way out here. After continuous failure, Captain Shang tells her to pack up and go home; but she doesn't. Instead she climbs up the pole and gets that arrow. As she admits later on, she's doing this for her father, but not *just* for her father.
* 'A Girl Worth Fighting For' is a cheery, upbeat number to cover the time spent marching, though it ends abruptly mid-sentence when the troops come upon the burned village and the remains of the Imperial Army. The subsequent battle on the mountain pass, culminating with the avalanche that wipes out most of the Huns, is one of the most impressive and exciting set pieces in any Disney animated film, and the climax in the Imperial City is nearly as good.

**In Conclusion**

A dramatic, exciting, and relatable story from beginning to end, with likable characters and good music. Definitely top-tier stuff.

"Your thoughts on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1996)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/24byvnb1wvab1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=771e72abd5cd888d3289ab923ecd23d99f74e9b9

**Overview**

How did Disney ever manage to make a children's movie out of *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*? Well, the answer is, they changed virtually everything about the story and the characters. Even having done that, however, they still came out with the darkest, moodiest, most dramatic movie in the WDAS canon. *Hunchback* is short on comedy and whimsy, and long on themes of lust, damnation, and genocide, and some of it is bound to sail over the heads of most children. Despite its almost complete departure from its source novel, it's a great movie with a great story.

**Point by Point**

* The visuals and music are striking and impressive right away, from the first shot of Notre Dame cathedral peeking through the clouds, and the first chords of the epic opening song 'The Bells of Notre Dame'. Quasimodo's backstory really sets the tone for the rest of the movie; within the first five minutes we see Frollo murder a woman and attempt to drown her baby in a well. (It ain't *The Aristocats*, that's for sure.)
* As the song says, Frollo ""saw corruption everywhere, except within."" He's a hypocrite of the highest order; as pious as he is hateful; the kind of man who has read the Bible from cover to cover without truly comprehending a word of it. He's a liar, a sadist, and a murderer, and he *revels* in it. Yet, when it comes to the matter of sin, he looks only outward at everyone around him. At least villains like Maleficent, Ursula, and Jafar are true to themselves and their ideologies, but Frollo is torturing and murdering people while holding himself to be an arbiter of justice and godliness. Sadly, there have always been people like that in this world.
* Quasimodo is characterized well. In the novel he's deaf, and kind of a simpleton, but Disney retools him here to make him a more functional, more relatable protagonist (and also more central to the narrative). The way he swings and leaps agilely around the outside of the cathedral, across the towers, gutters, and parapets, is very well conceived and animated. In this way, he's not a prisoner; the entire cathedral is his playground.
* *Hunchback* is extremely light on humor, with the trio of gargoyles providing the only substantial comedy relief. I think their presence is necessary, if only so Quasimodo can have someone to talk to. Years of isolation and Frollo's emotional abuse have really taken their toll, and having Quasimodo just completely alone would be way too gloomy.
* The Festival of Fools is a fun, colorful sequence (where Esmeralda performs as sexually charged a dance as Disney could likely get away with); that is, until the crowd turns on Quasimodo and begins to humiliate and abuse him in a scene that's genuinely difficult to watch.
* 'God Help the Outcasts' is a beautiful song, and the lavish interior shots of the cathedral are breathtaking. In fact, everything in this movie looks spectacular. It just might be the best-looking Disney animated film done in the traditional style.
* Phoebus is the handsome jock to Quasimodo's shy nerd; he's the traditional hero type with whom Esmeralda falls in love. Given this, it would have been easy for Disney to portray him as an arrogant jerk who ultimately turns out to be a villain (especially since this is kind of how he is in the novel), clearing the way for Quasimodo to emerge as the rightful heir to Esmeralda's affections. But Phoebus is actually a good guy. As much as Quasimodo deserves love, I think it speaks well of the filmmakers that they didn't contrive to couple him up with the female lead in the end.
* 'Hellfire', of course, is a highlight of the film, and one of the best songs in the WDAS canon. It's powerful, intense, and woven perfectly into the narrative. And it's not even a song for the kids, because it's all about Frollo's panic over his lust for a woman and his frenzy to root it out.
* The movie only picks up from here, with Frollo's mad crusade to find Esmeralda eventually consuming all of Paris. The sequence at the Court of Miracles, and then the climactic siege of Notre Dame after Quasimodo's dramatic, visually stunning rescue of Esmeralda from the pyre. It's all a fantastic set piece that ends up extremely satisfying, to a soaring reprise of 'The Bells of Notre Dame'.

**In Conclusion**

One of the best Disney movies yet, if not *the* best. Gorgeous visuals and music, great characters, and deeper than usual themes all combine to deliver us a uniquely excellent film. Disney had never made something like this before, and probably never will again.

**Tier Ranking**

By the way, now that I've gotten through thirty-four Disney movies, I think I've gained enough of a frame of reference to begin ranking these by tier, which will be easier and ultimately more meaningful than ranking by number. (Within the tiers, they're listed in order of release.)

performs as sexually charged a dance as disney could likely get away with that is until the crowd turns on quasimodo and begins to humiliate and abuse him in a scene thats genuinely difficult to watch god help the outcasts is a beautiful song and the lavish interior shots of the cathedral are breathtaking in fact everything in this movie looks spectacular it just might be the bestlooking disney animated film done in the traditional style phoebus is the handsome jock to quasimodos shy nerd hes the traditional hero type with whom esmeralda falls in love given this it would have been easy for disney to portray him as an arrogant jerk who ultimately turns out to be a villain especially since this is kind of how he is in the novel clearing the way for quasimodo to emerge as the rightful heir to esmeraldas affections but phoebus is actually a good guy as much as quasimodo deserves love i think it speaks well of the filmmakers that they didnt contrive to couple him up with the female lead in the end hellfire of course is a highlight of the film and one of the best songs in the wdas canon its powerful intense and woven perfectly into the narrative and its not even a song for the kids because its all about frollos panic over his lust for a woman and his frenzy to root it out the movie only picks up from here with frollos mad crusade to find esmeralda eventually consuming all of paris the sequence at the court of miracles and then the climactic siege of notre dame after quasimodos dramatic visually stunning rescue of esmeralda from the pyre its all a fantastic set piece that ends up extremely satisfying to a soaring reprise of the bells of notre dame in conclusion one of the best disney movies yet if not the best gorgeous visuals and music great characters and deeper than

Subtitles Inclusivity,"Walt Disney Studios is one of the top five major film studios and controls more money than I can imagine, yet Disney+ has such a limited range of subtitle languages, some shows even lack them entirely. For a studio with such a global reach this seems ridiculous? 

  
The range of dubbed languages is much larger, but will not include all the languages of Disney's audience- it's so much quicker and cheaper to just add subtitles so could cover an even larger range of languages and would be accessible to those with hearing loss.   
I am learning French, and have had no luck finding any French subtitles on Disney+. In desperation I went to Miraculous Ladybug, an actual French show, that still had no French subtitles (although this might be a blessing in disguise for my sanity)

  
I understand that the service has launched relatively recently in comparison to some others, but this still seems unacceptable, especially with recent advances in auto-translate technologies. It may be an issue specifically with my region, but there are obviously still people in my region who speak languages other than English.

"Your thoughts on ""Pocahontas"" (1995)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y1l7uf6rhab1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de059d4c0f939ed795b74a894b0a814e3767d7b9

**Overview**

*Pocahontas* isn't historically accurate, let's get that out of the way right now. It's not an account of something that really happened. It's a fairy tale, starring fictional characters who just happen to be named after people who lived four hundred years ago. But that can be said of a lot of great movies purported to be based on historical people and events; movies like *Braveheart*, *Gladiator*, and *The Sound of Music*. So, let's not judge *Pocahontas* too harshly on that score; it still accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is tell a good story, sing a few songs, and teach the kiddies a lesson about tolerance.

**Point by Point**

* The movie opens with John Smith, Governor Ratcliffe, and the other settlers boarding their ship to leave England, then dealing with a squall at sea, during which Smith saves a young sailor named Thomas from drowning. After that bit of excitement, we transition to the Native Americans singing and harvesting. It seems peaceful and idyllic, but Chief Powhatan and the other men have just returned from a war with a rival nation. It's an acknowledgement that violence and conflict existed in the New World long before the white man showed up.
* The visuals and scenery are beautiful; definitely the best-looking forest landscapes since *Bambi*.
* Pocahontas is beautiful, graceful, and free-spirited. The first thing we see her do is dive off a high cliff into the water below. She's well animated, and the way she moves is unique. She's not just Belle in a buckskin. When she runs she takes huge strides and pounds the earth with her feet, arms pumping at her sides. And when she's spying on John Smith, she creeps along the ground and over rocks like someone accustomed to moving stealthily through the forest.
* I'd say that *Pocahontas* is easily the most serious Disney animated film yet (though it is surpassed in this by its immediate successor, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*). There's a lot of drama and talking, and not very much comedy, although Meeko, Flit, and Percy provide some occasional slapstick. Personally, as an adult viewer, I'm fine with that. During this marathon through the movies, I'm finding I have a greater appreciation for the drama and less of a desire to see it interrupted by excessive comedy.
* The initial meeting between Pocahontas and John Smith, and the first skirmish between the settlers and the Indians, are both good sequences, as is the colorful, invigorating montage set to 'Colors of the Wind'. 'Mine, Mine, Mine' is a rousing number as well.
* Judging by the conversation Ratcliffe has with his servant, Wiggins, he's not exactly in favor with King James at this time. He's greedy, for sure, but he's not looking for gold just so he can buy nice things; he needs that gold in order to buy back his reputation at court. That's why he's so desperately ready to believe that the Indians are hiding the gold from him; because the only alternative is that there is no gold, and if there's no gold, he's finished.
* Tensions have been building between the two camps, and they come to a head when Thomas ends up shooting the warrior (and Pocahontas' potential suitor) Kocoum in defense of John Smith. The climactic song 'Savages' really drives home the hatred that each side feels for the other, with both the settlers and the Indians regarding each other as ""barely even human"". It's not subtle, but, hey, it's a kids' movie.
* The moment when Pocahontas stops a war by saving John Smith from her father's wrath is a good one, and, just in case you thought the drama was over, Smith ends up taking a bullet for Powhatan immediately afterwards. Smith has to be taken back to England to heal (and Ratcliffe has to be taken back to face justice), but Pocahontas chooses to stay at home. Notably, *Pocahontas* is the first instance in the WDAS canon of the primary romance splitting up at the end. The two leads do not live happily ever after together. Kudos to Disney for not sticking Pocahontas on that ship.

**In Conclusion**

It may not be peak Disney, but *Pocahontas* is a good, low-key adventure with drama, romance, some good songs, a constructive social lesson, and visuals that, in their own way, look as good as those in *The Lion King*. I enjoyed it.

**Overview**

What is there to say about *The Lion King* that hasn't already been said? It's peak Disney, and very few films in the WDAS canon have achieved its prestige and legacy. It was the highest grossing film of its release year, it has become a multimedia franchise unto itself, and it is still regarded today as one of the best animated films ever.

**Point by Point**

* The opening hits hard and fast, with that burning sun and the soaring opening chords of 'Circle of Life'. That's literally the first thing your senses get as the movie begins. No ""Walt Disney Presents"". No storybook opening. Just ""BAAAAAAAAAA BAKWANZAAAAAAA!!!"" (And yes, I know those aren't the lyrics, but I don't speak Zulu, so that's what I'm hearing.) *The Lion King* really is the best-looking Disney animated feature so far, and this opening sequence exemplifies that with its colors, lighting, and animation. The animals, too, look better than ever. Baby Simba's presentation ceremony is invigorating, and really sets the tone.
* Scar, of course, is a great villain; clever, conniving, intimidating, and, at his core, extremely petty. He longs to be king, but only because he believes, myopically, that it will make him happy and fulfilled; only because he wants to be ""respected, saluted, and seen for the wonder I am"". He has no interest in actually being in charge; in being responsible for the well-being of the pride. When he does finally achieve his ambition, he just sits around while everything goes to hell. He's king, and he does nothing with it. As Mufasa points out to Simba, ""There's more to being king than getting your way all the time.""
* Most Disney animated films have one or two signature songs that really stand out and become inextricably linked with the film's identity. *Dumbo* has 'When I See an Elephant Fly'; *The Little Mermaid* has 'Part of Your World' and 'Under the Sea'; *Frozen* has 'Let It Go'. In *The Lion King*'s case, however, I think all of the songs loom equally large in our cultural consciousness, whether it's the fun, colorful, and raucous 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King', the moody villain song 'Be Prepared', the joyful and catchy 'Hakuna Matata', or the romantic ballad 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight'. Any of these songs (along with, of course, the aforementioned 'Circle of Life') is liable to pop into your head when you think of *The Lion King*.
* Likewise, it's amazing how Disney's visuals and animation have taken yet another quantum leap forward. We've just had *Beauty and the Beast* and *Aladdin*, yet *The Lion King* manages to look even better. The animals themselves are designed exquisitely, and every setting - from the sprawling, sun-baked Savannah, to the eerie elephant graveyard, to Timon and Pumbaa's idyllic oasis - is breathtaking. The stampede is an incredible set piece, immersive and overwhelming.
* I knew that *The Lion King* took some light inspiration from *Hamlet*, but, in doing my due diligence for this entry in the Disney canon, I learned that the Biblical story of Moses was also considered. I didn't see much similarity at first, apart from Moses exiling himself in the wilderness for years, but, under closer scrutiny, Rafiki's appearance to Simba and his exhortation to him to return could be a parallel to Moses' ""burning bush"" moment.
* The third act is full of good moments, whether it's the dramatic appearance of Mufasa's admonishing spirit, or the abrupt and absurd hula number performed by Timon and Pumbaa amidst the incongruous menace and gloom. The final clash between Simba and Scar is properly epic, and Scar's comeuppance is extremely satisfying. A cleansing rain follows, Simba assumes the throne, and, as we see in the film's final frames, the circle of life continues.

**In Conclusion**

With tremendous visuals and music, a great story, and top-notch performances by an all-star cast, *The Lion King* takes the throne. I did wrestle a bit, as I feel like I enjoyed *Beauty and the Beast* and *The Little Mermaid* just a bit more (I seem to be partial to the princess movies for some reason), but I just can't justify ranking *The Lion King* lower, so, to the top it goes. Eventually, when all's said and done, I'm going to have to break this list into tiers for a more accurate picture of my ranking.

**Overview**

Over the decades Disney had delivered us several fairy tales set in medieval Europe, a few in Victorian England, and even one or two in the urban United States, but *Aladdin* marked the first story set in exotic and unfamiliar Arabia. A favorite of the Disney Renaissance, *Aladdin* is a dazzling and adventurous tale, distinguished by its greater than usual emphasis on comedy, thanks largely to the performance by the late, great Robin Williams, who was allowed to improvise much of his dialogue.

**Point by Point**

* The opening is sweeping and majestic, set to the bombastic tune of 'Arabian Nights', and establishes the setting right away as one with which we're less familiar. The visuals, in general, are exquisitely colorful, and both characters and backgrounds look as if they could have been lifted from a storybook. The Cave of Wonders - both outside and inside - and the ""ends of the Earth"", with its driving blizzard, are both particular stand-outs.
* Like *Beauty and the Beast*'s 'Belle', the opening song 'One Jump Ahead' is an excellent character anthem that makes us immediately familiar with the main protagonist, his world, and his plight. After getting to know Aladdin as we watch him go to great lengths to escape the palace guards with a stolen loaf of bread, we see him hesitate only a moment before handing his hard-won bread over to a pair of starving orphan children. Moments later, he throws himself into harm's way to protect those same children from the cruel whip of a visiting prince. Abu is a good sidekick, providing mischief and comic relief.
* Jafar is an excellent villain; dark, slimy, conniving, and mostly competent. Maleficent and Ursula are still my favorites, but I'm not talking down Jafar. He's definitely one of Disney's strongest antagonists.
* The Genie, of course, grabs the movie with both hands and runs away with it the first moment he appears. He definitely pulls focus throughout the rest of the show, but his magical nature and the spirit of Robin Williams make him a natural star. He allows for a lot of comedy and spectacle, both of which inform the terrific songs 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali'.
* 'A Whole New World' is the midway showstopper we've come to expect from this era of Disney movies. Not only is it a great song (it won an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Golden Globe), but the visuals of the Magic Carpet ride through the night and across multiple countries are gorgeous.
* Jafar seizing control of the Genie and banishing Aladdin might present the most daunting ""all is lost"" moment we've seen yet in a Disney animated movie. That's what makes Aladdin's storming of the palace and his confrontation with Jafar so exciting, and Jafar's comeuppance so satisfying. (I like that Jafar's ideal look for the captive Jasmine is basically Peggy Bundy from *Married...With Children*. You know, with the trashy clothes and the big hair. I guess that's just what gets Jafar's engine running.)
* It seems like it was a little too easy for the Sultan to change the law about Jasmine needing to marry a prince. He can just do that, unilaterally and arbitrarily? And if he could have done that all along, then *why didn't he?*

**In Conclusion**

With its excellent visuals and music and fun story, *Aladdin* is definitely a masterpiece, there's no doubt about that. Having said that, however, I didn't connect with the characters and their struggles quite as effectively as I did with those in my favorites, nor was I as awed by it as I was those other films. And I'm sure I'm asking for trouble here, but I found Robin Williams' routines to be a little bit much at times. (Like the merchant bit at the beginning was a bit cringe. And what was the point of the Jack Nicholson impression?) I know this is going to be unpopular, but, while it still gets a position of honor, I can't place it right at the top.

**Overview**

Okay, after a brief diversion with *The Rescuers Down Under*, we're back in the bloom of the Disney Renaissance; back on Broadway! Disney puts their own, unique spin on another beloved fairy tale, and boy, does it pay off. Utilizing new animation technology and new methods for their songwriting, Walt Disney Animation Studios gave us what is still considered to this day to be one of their best films. It was even nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture the following year. No disrespect to *The Silence of the Lambs*, but *Beauty and the Beast* deserved that award.

**Point by Point**

* *Beauty and the Beast* is exquisite from the outset. The stained glass windows are an excellent way of summing up the Beast's backstory, and a creative departure from the traditional storybook intro. The lavish artistry on display here really sets the tone for the masterpiece that's to come.
* The visuals and animation are better than in any Disney movie seen so far, surpassing even *The Little Mermaid*. The music, too, is tremendous. The opening number, 'Belle', is a great character song, effectively introducing us to the heroine. And, in the same song, we meet Gaston, who serves as an excellent subversion of the Prince Charming trope. Under normal circumstances he'd be the hero of the story, but he's not just handsome and strong; he's also arrogant, selfish, and cruel.
* Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts (as well as the rest of the castle servants) are good additions to the cast. You can't have just the Beast, after all; too lonely and dour. Lumiere and Cogsworth, in particular, share an effective dynamic.
* Upon our first proper look at the Beast, when he's menacing Maurice, he's quite fearsome and intimidating; hulking and savage. And he's not misunderstood or maligned, either. At this point in the story, the Beast is awful; he's petty, vindictive, and uncaring. Remember the act of callousness that got him into this mess in the first place? Well, he just repeated it with Maurice, denying the old man shelter for the night. Over the long years cooped up in his castle he's learned nothing.
* The lavish musical numbers of *Beauty and the Beast* really do drive home how far we've come since 'Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat'. The song 'Gaston' is a rousing crowd-pleaser, and 'Be Our Guest' is probably the most spectacular number in a Disney movie up to this point.
* Belle's panicked flight from the castle, out into the snow, and the Beast rescuing her from a pack of wolves is an exciting sequence. And, somehow, her leaving later to find her father (with the Beast's blessing) is just as dramatic.
* The ballroom scene; the visuals, the animation, and Angela Lansbury's stirring rendition of the title song. (Reportedly, she performed it perfectly on her first try, and everyone in the studio was weeping.) *Nothing* that Disney had done up to this point is better than this.
* 'The Mob Song' is the perfect number to suit the ever more villainous Gaston, and leads directly into one of the best action climaxes yet, particularly the rooftop duel between Gaston and the Beast. And the transformation of the Beast, the servants, and the castle itself is breathtaking.

**In Conclusion**

I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. *Beauty and the Beast* is the best WDAS movie so far, and one of the best in general. What more is there to say?

"Your thoughts on ""The Rescuers Down Under"" (1990)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Circa the mid-1980s, *The Rescuers* had become one of Disney's most successful animated films. Thus it became the first WDAS movie to receive a sequel. With no songs, and with a greater emphasis on action, *The Rescuers Down Under* attempts to be more of an adventure movie. It pleased critics, but underperformed at the box office, thanks in large part to sharing its release date with the smash hit *Home Alone*.

**Point by Point**

* Whereas Bernard and Bianca were rarely offscreen in the original *The Rescuers*, this film focuses a good deal on just the child, Cody. In the first few minutes we see him free soloing a huge, sheer cliff, like Ethan Hunt at the start of *Mission: Impossible 2*, then soaring high above the clouds on the back of Marahute, the great golden eagle. (Obviously not the same animal as the real-life [golden eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle), which is considerably smaller, not endangered, and not found in Australia.)
* McLeach is a decent villain; not one of the all-time greats, but well-suited to this particular story. He's slimy, bad-tempered, and intimidating. I feel bad for his pet lizard, Joanna. McLeach is repeatedly abusive to her, always kicking her in the stomach or threatening to shoot her. It drives home how heartless and cruel he is.
* The difference in art styles between this movie and its predecessor are apparent right away. *The Rescuers* looks like a 1970s Disney movie, and *The Rescuers Down Under* looks like a 1990s Disney movie. It's got some good-looking scenes, including the mouse restaurant on top of the chandelier, and practically every moment that takes place in the Outback.
* John Candy's Wilbur is a good substitute for Orville (whose voice actor, Jim Jordan, had passed away). Speaking of Wilbur, does anyone else think his scenes at the mouse clinic seem a little...out of place? The mouse doctor is crazy and sadistic, and he and his nurses torture Wilbur, and menace him with a chainsaw. And we're supposed to...laugh, I guess? I dunno, it just strikes me as cruel and unpleasant, and it doesn't do anything to benefit the story.
* The scene with Cody locked up with McLeach's captured animals seems like it's just there to kill time. It doesn't serve the plot in any way. You could cut it out completely and the movie would remain unaffected. The climax at Crocodile Falls, where McLeach attempts to feed Cody to the crocs, is sufficiently exciting and moody, and McLeach gets a satisfying comeuppance.

**In Conclusion**

More of a brief diversion from the Disney Renaissance than an actual part of it, *The Rescuers Down Under* is honestly rather bland, and feels lacking in the same spirit and heart that made the original a standout of a mediocre era.

Isn't it False Advertising to have pull content on the ondisneyplus Disney website?,"There are posts for Stargirl and Hollywood Stargirl on the ondisneyplus Disney website even though they have both been recently removed from platform.

"Your thoughts on ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/04yhton70k8b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f61b9464aa0281786e426c9d76b7a0914be6e1b

**Overview**

The start of the Disney Renaissance! *The Little Mermaid* has more effort and more budget put into it than any WDAS movie in decades, and it shows. Not only has the animation and storytelling taken a quantum leap forward, but I think this is the first WDAS movie that could really, properly be described as a musical. The songs in prior Disney features are mostly incidental, or are meant to provide atmosphere, but *The Little Mermaid* is like a Broadway show; its songs are very much woven into the DNA of the narrative. This new formula and new devotion to the art form would pave the way for a prestigious run of films throughout the 1990s, the likes of which Disney had not seen before and has not seen since.

**Point by Point**

* Right away, the underwater environments and the colorful flora and fauna are impressive. Ariel is cute, feisty, and instantly likable. Her fiery red hair is iconic, but I think her most striking feature is her huge, expressive eyes (yes, her eyes). Like Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora before her, she wins the viewer's sympathy and love almost immediately. Flounder, Sebastian, and Scuttle all make good sidekicks.
* Ursula is easily the darkest, most intimidating villain since Cruella de Vil. With the slimy insidiousness of an octopus and the exaggerated manner of a drag performer, her presence is domineering and her personality unforgettable. I think she and Maleficent are my favorite Disney villains.
* The scene in Ariel's grotto full of human artifacts, where she sings 'Part of Your World', really demonstrates the quality of *The Little Mermaid*. The animation, the lighting, Ariel's expressiveness, and Jodi Benson's tremendous singing voice all contribute. This leads straight into Ariel's rescue of Prince Eric from the violent storm, which is one of the most dramatically exciting sequences we've seen in a Disney movie in some time, and that shot of her singing on the rock while she watches Eric on the beach and the surf crashes behind her is exquisite.
* The songs in this movie really soar. As I noted above, the Broadway influence really makes a difference. Prior Disney movies had numbers performed by choruses or jazz musicians, but *The Little Mermaid* is giving its all with material that Andrew Lloyd Webber would be proud of. The insanely bouncy and colorful 'Under the Sea' is a proper showstopper.
* After Triton's dramatic destruction of Ariel's collection, Ursula's two eels slither on in, like the serpent in Eden, and put a flea in Ariel's ear about seeking help from the sea witch. Ursula dwells inside the carcass of some long-dead behemoth, guarded by a menagerie of wretched creatures that used to be mermaids and mermen and were foolish enough to strike a bargain with her. We know that Triton exiled her from the palace some indeterminate amount of time prior, but we don't know why. Her song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' is a great villain anthem that starts out velvety and coaxing, then grows more boisterous and more insistent until Ursula is practically shouting at Ariel to accept her Faustian bargain. The tension climaxes with Ursula's occult chanting, and then Ariel's tail splitting into a pair of human legs as Flounder and Sebastian rush her to the surface.
* Ariel trying to adjust to surface life - combing her hair with a fork, etc. - is good for comedy, as is the sequence in the kitchen with Sebastian and Chef Louis.
* 'Kiss the Girl' is another great musical sequence; catchy, magical, with sparkling, moonlit scenery.
* The climax is spectacular and exciting, starting with Ariel crashing Eric and Ursula's wedding, getting her voice back, and freeing Eric of Ursula's enchantment. But the sun sets and Ariel changes back into a mermaid. Ursula grabs her and takes her back down into the sea, where she's intercepted by Triton. Seeing no other alternative, Triton consents to take Ariel's place in Ursula's ""garden"", and Ursula seizes his crown and trident. She grows immense, and uses her new power to summon a hurricane and raise wrecks from the deep. Fortunately, Eric is able to use one of these wrecks to impale her, and she dies in dramatic fashion.
* The finale is extremely satisfying, with Triton using his power to turn Ariel back into a human and blessing her marriage to Eric. All's well that ends well.

**In Conclusion**

Not only is *The Little Mermaid* the best Disney animated movie since *Sleeping Beauty*, but I think it actually surpasses it. It took three decades of lesser entries, but Walt Disney's 1959 masterpiece is finally toppled from its high throne.

Fixing the Pillarbox Effect for Shows on Disney+,"I've noticed that a lot of old TV shows on Disney+ in 4:3 aspect ratio (Doogie Howser, Ally McBeal, Family Guy, etc.) will be ""pillarboxed"" to 16:9. Essentially, black bars will be added to the right and left sides of the source video to force it into a 16:9 aspect ratio.

However, since these boxes are added to the *source* of the video, and not the *displayed* video, when you try watching one of these shows on a 4:3 monitor, it looks like a postage stamp.

[\\""postage stamp\\"" effect \(black bars all around the actual picture\)](https://preview.redd.it/thmmbbr2d78b1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=f412561af7e843e1abdf350a6a5e204e15d7c8cd)

This is a combination of the pillarbox forcing a 4:3 video into a 16:9 aspect ratio, and then being displayed on a 4:3 monitor. If Disney+ didn't force pillarboxing on these shows, this problem wouldn't exist.

For example, a lot of Disney Channel originals (Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, etc) are uploaded in their native 4:3 aspect ratio, and look fine on these displays.

As a big fan of retro TV, I love watching these old shows on 4:3 monitors, but getting ""postage stamped"" by Disney+ ruins it. It drove me so nuts that I built a Google Chrome extension to fix this problem.

Once the extension is enabled, it will remove the pillarboxing for old shows and display them correctly:

[postage stamp effect removed with the extension](https://preview.redd.it/87bl4ewpe78b1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2105f9f02624051e696ee9f3ec52f9fe431be96)

**It only does this on 4:3 monitors**, so if you're watching on a normal 16:9 monitor, your shows won't be affected. It also **won't apply this effect to shows that are already natively in 4:3**, like the Disney Channel original TV shows. However, if you're watching a show that's in 16:9, it'll scale it so that you don't get a letterbox effect on your 4:3 monitor (you can easily disable this effect through the plugin options menu).

I understand that this is an incredibly niche problem to have and solve, but I figured at least one other person would have this issue. The plugin is entirely [open source](https://github.com/nicholasc120/Disney-PillarUnboxing) and link to download is [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disney%2B-pillar-unboxing/fbclpdcoipildpbipaoddfoaijleaemm).

&#x200B;

edit: Another use case: I like watching TV on an old CRT and feed an input through from my PC, but the pillarboxing ruins it. Here's a before and after when using the extension on this type of display:

"Your thoughts on ""The Great Mouse Detective"" (1986)","

**Overview**

Based on the Basil of Baker Street series of children's novels (which, in turn, were based on Sherlock Holmes), *The Great Mouse Detective* follows the adventures of Basil (named after famed Sherlock Holmes actor Basil Rathbone, of course), who lives in Holmes' basement and solves cases brought to him by the rodent community. It was successful both critically and commercially, and, in the wake of the disaster that was *The Black Cauldron*, it revitalized WDAS and very probably saved the studio.

**Point by Point**

* Basil is just as brilliant as Holmes at deductive reasoning, and also just as eccentric and socially awkward. It takes Dawson and Olivia time to get through to him, and he only really becomes interested in the case of Olivia's missing father when he realizes that he can link it to his nemesis, Professor Ratigan.
* 'The World's Greatest Criminal Mind' is a good instance of character development set to music; that's what songs in musicals really ought to be for. Basil has already talked Ratigan up as the Napoleon of crime, but now we get to know him firsthand. In particular we see that he is a rat with a sort of self-hatred complex, and insists that he is actually just a large mouse. When one of his men makes the mistake of referring to him as a rat, Ratigan feeds him to Felicia, his pet cat.
* *The Great Mouse Detective* isn't overly exciting, though it does have some good sequences, including the action scene in the toy shop, the investigation at the seedy tavern, and the escape from Ratigan's death trap. The climactic scene inside of Big Ben, set against a black void of clicking, grinding gears, is appropriately atmospheric. When Ratigan loses his temper he finally becomes a rat - all claws and teeth and hunched back - and the battle moves outside for an exciting finale on Big Ben's face.

**In Conclusion**

*The Great Mouse Detective* is okay. It's no masterpiece, and it's a little cheesy at times, but it has its charms, particularly for children and for fans of Sherlock Holmes. I wish I had more to say about it, but I think I've covered everything of note. Its greatest legacy is that it helped pave the way for the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s.

**Overview**

Of all the ranging and diverse movies turned out by Walt Disney Animation Studios over almost a century now, *The Black Cauldron* is probably the most obscure; the least beloved. Inspired loosely by *The Chronicles of Prydain*, a series of fantasy novels by Lloyd Alexander, it was possibly the studio's greatest misfire, and its expensive, spectacular failure actually cast doubt on the future of Disney animated films.

**Point by Point**

* Frankly, it's not difficult to see why *The Black Cauldron* failed to resonate with audiences. To start off, none of the characters are interesting or even particularly likable. Most of them are just generic cliches from the fantasy genre. There's the farm boy who wants to be a mighty warrior; there's a tagalong princess who isn't really good for anything; there's a comedy relief minstrel; and there's a weird, furry mascot who's strikingly similar to Gollum. And none of them are endowed with interesting personalities or histories. We don't learn what makes them tick. They don't deal with personal conflicts and grow into better people. They're just there because the story requires them to be there.
* And as for the story, it's astonishingly bland for a Disney movie. It's not as if the people at Disney didn't understand how to craft an effective narrative, yet it's boring and unengaging from beginning to end; no highs and lows to remark on, just one long, flat line of *blah*. There's a magic sword, but we're never told of its nature or its origin. There's supposed to be a romance brewing between the male protagonist and the princess, but their interactions are completely devoid of chemistry. The villain's goal is ill-defined (something about wanting to use the Cauldron to create an undead army), and, once achieved, is undone almost immediately. And Gurgi's self-sacrifice at the end fails to evoke any emotional response because, again, I don't care about *any* of these characters.
* And there aren't any songs either. Now, that's not innately a bad thing. WDAS has turned out some great films over the years that haven't been reliant on musical numbers, but the lack of music and whimsy here does the already lackluster *Black Cauldron* no favors.

**In Conclusion**

*The Black Cauldron* is such a dramatic departure from what you'd expect from a Disney animated movie. It simply doesn't have anything to recommend it, and it deserves its place in relative obscurity. It's easily the weakest film in the WDAS canon. I'd even rank it below the anthology films of the 1940s, because at least those made me smile.

**Overview**

Though it's not apparent from an aesthetic standpoint, *The Fox and the Hound* marked the end of an era at Disney. The core animators and creative talents who had been working diligently for Walt Disney since before *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* all retired on this project, necessitating an influx of new blood. Most of these had been trained in-house, but the generational gap led to significant creative disputes, which led in turn to production delays. Notably, Don Bluth (who had previously worked on *Robin Hood*, *The Rescuers*, and *Pete's Dragon*) resigned, took a bunch of other animators with him, and set up his own production company. Throughout the 1980s Bluth would produce and release *The Secret of NIMH*, *An American Tail*, *The Land Before Time*, and *All Dogs Go to Heaven*, all of which are regarded highly today.

**Point by Point**

* The opening of *The Fox and the Hound* is eerie and tense, with a hunted mother fox carrying her baby as she flees the hounds. She drops him at the farm owned by the Widow Tweed, and is killed almost immediately afterwards. Big Mama, a kind owl, arranges for the fox to be adopted by the Widow, who names him Tod. At just about the same time, her neighbor Amos Slade brings home Copper, a new bloodhound pup.
* Tod and Copper are both cute, and it's fun to watch them play. Of course, chaos ensues the first time Slade and his other dog, Chief, discover Tod on their property. (Slade isn't the villain of the story. He's kind of a dick, and he has an itchy trigger finger, but he's not evil.)
* After Slade and the dogs return from a months long hunting trip, Tod and Copper - both adults now - have a brief reunion, during which Copper expresses happiness at seeing Tod, but informs him that their erstwhile friendship can't continue. The scene abruptly turns to a chase when Chief notices Tod. Slade and the two dogs chase Tod into hiding; Copper corners him, but allows him to escape. Immediately after this, Chief chases Tod onto a railroad trestle and into the path of a train. The train strikes Chief, and Copper - angry at himself for having let Tod escape - vows revenge.
* Chief survives his run-in with the train, getting away with just a broken leg. This served as one of the aforementioned bones of contention between the older filmmakers (who balked at killing Chief off) and the younger (who maintained the conflict didn't make sense if Chief survived). Personally, I think the story would have been better served by Chief's death, but I get it. Children's entertainment is evolving all the time, and, in 1981, Disney simply wasn't ready to give us a Mufasa moment. They hadn't come quite that far yet.
* With Slade gunning for Tod, the Widow has no choice but to release him onto the nearby game preserve, where she imagines he'll be safe. It's sad, because she's saying goodbye to her beloved pet and companion, who she raised from a cub. Of course, Tod isn't used to living wild, and he has a rough first night of it. The next day, with Big Mama's help, he meets Vixey, a lovely female fox, and things begin to look brighter.
* Slade and Copper, in their wrath, are willing to trespass on the game preserve and poach Tod. After a chase, and some scuffling between Tod and Copper, a huge grizzly bear appears out of nowhere and attacks Slade and Copper. Slade, with his foot caught in one of his own traps and his gun out of reach, is defenseless, and Copper has the fight knocked out of him. Tod could be well and away with Vixey and leave his pursuers to their fate, but, because of what Copper once was to him, he goes back and attacks the bear on their behalf.
* The moment after the fight with the bear, when Copper steps in front of Tod to shield him from Slade...I don't believe that's simply a matter of ""Well, he saved our lives, so I'll save his"", although that's certainly part of it. Copper doesn't growl and snarl at his master; he isn't taking a rebellious, disloyal stand. He looks at Slade gently, imploringly, as if to say, ""Dad, we have to let this go. Tod hurt us, but killing him doesn't accomplish anything. We have to let go of this rage and this hatred, if only for our own sakes. This isn't us, Dad. Let's go home."" Judging by the softening and ultimately accepting expression on Slade's face, the message gets through.

**In Conclusion**

Following on from *The Rescuers*, *The Fox and the Hound* is another dark-ish Disney film, with some slightly heavier themes than those found in *One Hundred and One Dalmatians*, *The Sword in the Stone*, or *Robin Hood*. It's the kind of film your kids can learn from as they grow older. Though I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, I'd say it holds up.

"Your thoughts on ""The Rescuers"" (1977)","https://preview.redd.it/i4b1cirejj6b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2d39013b0d6a7757aa7676b31f8fab529d891ca

**Overview**

Taking light inspiration from a series of children's books by author Margery Sharp, *The Rescuers* is a fairly low-key, straightforward adventure film that just happens to star two talking mice. It received near universal acclaim from critics and was a box office success, and this would lead to a sequel being released thirteen years later.

**Point by Point**

* *The Rescuers* gets straight to the point. The very first thing we see onscreen is a little girl aboard a shadowy riverboat down on the bayou, tiptoeing past a couple of sinister-looking crocodiles and dropping a bottled plea for rescue into the water. The opening credits play over still paintings of the bottle being tossed over waves and through storms, while the moody song 'The Journey' plays, until it reaches New York City.
* Bernard and Bianca are both immediately likable protagonists, with personalities that compliment each other. Bernard is a worrywart, and Bianca tends to fly by the seat of her pants. This makes for a good ""odd couple"" dynamic between the two.
* While Bernard and Bianca are searching for clues at the orphanage from which Penny disappeared, we're treated to a flashback sequence that introduces us to Penny. She's a sad little girl who just wants to be adopted by some nice couple, and it's easy to sympathize right away with her. She's cute, but not obnoxiously so.
* At one point during the movie's development, there was the idea to have Cruella de Vil return and serve as the villain. This notion was ultimately scrapped, of course, but Madame Medusa is Cruella in all but name, from the trashy clothes to the bad temper to the horrific driving skills. And though she's a relatively obscure and unremarkable figure in Disney's pantheon of villains, Madame Medusa might be one of the studio's most despicable. Characters like Maleficent and Ursula are pure evil, of course, but they're just pretend. Nobody like them exists in real life. Medusa, on the other hand, is emblematic of a very real evil in this world; she's a cruel, ruthless person who will exploit and abuse a child to get what she wants. Sadly, there are children actually watching *The Rescuers* who have been victimized by Medusas of their own.
* *The Rescuers* definitely has the look of its time, but it stands out from other contemporary Disney releases with an overall darker, perhaps even muddier tone to its visuals, which fits its settings (New York City and the swamp) to a T. The backgrounds are particularly striking and colorful in an unconventional way. We hardly see any blue sky, for example. The scenes in New York are set against a smoggy sunset, and the sky above Devil's Bayou is a sulfuric yellow. It's very moody.
* *The Rescuers* has some amusing ideas in general; using an albatross as an airplane and a dragonfly as an outboard motor, and the sequence where the crocodiles ""play"" the pipe organ in order to get Bernard and Bianca out of the pipes.
* The sequence down in the pirates' cave is tense and suspenseful, and with an appropriate air of encroaching doom as the tide begins to surge in. We really do feel the urgency as Penny and the mice search for the large diamond, and then the triumph as they find it.
* The climax is action-packed, with various friendly swamp critters getting in on the act, attacking Medusa and setting off fireworks. The riverboat sinks, and the good guys get away on Medusa's ""swamp mobile"". Satisfyingly, Medusa's crocodiles turn on her.

**In Conclusion**

I'm inclined to agree with the reviewers of the time. *The Rescuers*, while not anything overly special, appears to be constructed with more artistry, originality, and heart than the past several Disney films, and is probably the best one since *Sleeping Beauty*. I enjoyed the characters and themes, and found the aesthetic choices in visual style and music enhanced the story.

"Your thoughts on ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (1977)","https://preview.redd.it/qcfdtvfbk86b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae311cb1c941df6db509579cf58ad80b26812375

**Overview**

*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh* is a compilation of three short Pooh features that had been produced and released by Disney in the preceding years; *Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree* (1966), *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day* (1968), and *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too* (1974). There's been a lot of Pooh-related media since, especially after the 1997 movie *Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin* sparked his popularity. Today Pooh is a multimedia franchise unto himself, but it all started with these earnest adaptations.

**Point by Point**

* The Pooh features honor their literary origins with a unique storybook format that allows for whimsical visual gags, occasionally showing the characters interacting with the words on the page or speaking with the narrator. It wouldn't work with most other characters, but it seems to fit Pooh and his friends just right.
* *Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree* is pretty basic, serving as an introduction to Pooh and his world. We see him perform his ""stoutness exercises"" (which only enhance his appetite), cooperate with Christopher Robin to try and trick some bees out of their honey, and eat Rabbit out of house and home, only to get himself stuck in the front door when he tries to leave. There are some good bits there, like Rabbit trying to adapt Pooh's rear end to his home decor, and Gopher (an original Disney character) repeatedly saying, ""I'm not in the book, you know.""
* *Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day* is more dynamic, with more action. We see Piglet blown through the air like a kite with Pooh hanging on, we see Owl's tree blow over and crash to the ground, and we meet the boisterous, rambunctious Tigger. The dream Pooh has about Heffalumps and Woozles is bizarre, and calls to mind 'Pink Elephants on Parade' from *Dumbo*. Then, of course, there's the rainstorm that floods the Hundred Acre Wood.
* *Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too* is good as well, but I think it's the least eventful and the least colorful of the three segments. Most of the focus is on how annoyed Rabbit is with getting repeatedly assaulted by Tigger.

**In Conclusion**

*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh* is strictly kids' stuff (and, considering the source material, that's hardly a surprise), but its whimsy and gentle humor makes it an enjoyable diversion for adult fans as well. I found myself smiling and chuckling in all the right places. Generally speaking, Pooh isn't something you hold onto as you grow older, but it can still be fun to go back and visit.

Fullscreen on next episode,"Exiting full screen on next episode autoplay annoyed me so much that I decided to fix it.

Warning: **Do not use scripts found on the internet** with Tampermonkey if you haven't reviewed them. They may be malicious. I understand the same goes for my script so I guess you should wait for some people to review it in the comments before using it.

&#x200B;

A little background for anyone interested:

So I investigated why it's exiting Fullscreen at all. As it turns out Disney made it on purpose and they use [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API) to make it happen.

The script linked above blocks exiting the Fullscreen if the user didn't click on anything within 0.5s. Using ESC to exit Fullscreen does not trigger an event so doing so is not blocked. I've only tested it on Opera and it seems to work so it should work on other modern browsers. However, it's not guaranteed.

Quotes

\[After T.J Detweiler had pranked Darius Deamonne with electromagnets Anne Boonchuy slams T.J Detweiler against the wall and pins him and candy is dropped to the floor Willow Park just watches from the counter\]

Anne Boonchuy: Are you froging kidding me?! Pulling a prank like that in my lobby? On a Coven Head of all the guests you had to choose?!

T.J Detweiler: Come on Anne? It was a good prank.

Anne Boonchuy: Really especially when it makes me and my parents’ hotel look bad! Man if your parents heard about this they would be just as mad as I am.

"D+: ""Cancel your account. We don't want your money.""","**TL;DR** \- After 5 hours of attempting to updated my billing information via the Android app, then via the a desktop browser, then via a phone call to customer service, and finally via ""customer support"" chat, Disney Plus essentially told me they are not interested in my money.

Full story:

Several weeks ago, my credit card was compromised, and I began seeing fraudulent charges pop up. I contacted my CC issuer, and they canceled the card and sent me a new one.

It was a little annoying, especially since I use this CC for nearly all subscriptions, but I figured I would just update them as the due dates came around and I received the notifications.

My D+ sub was on May 28, and I never received anything (and honestly, I wasn't tracking it that closely anyway). I just knew that, at some point, I would get the email that said, ""Hey, please update your billing info.""

That email from D+ was not a heads up, but rather more of a threat. (See screenshot.)

&#x200B;

[D+ Threat](https://preview.redd.it/rh17ghtwz25b1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=f361b6a3c6a0f18ebc1fa1615a939dfb22795a01)

Unfortunately, I was traveling at the time and had not been keeping a close eye on email. By the time I saw the email about 24 hours after it hit my inbox, it was already too late.

That **Update Payment Information** request was no longer valid, and so began the long, arduous trek through the D+ ""customer support"" jungle.

After multiple attempts to update my payment information via the mobile app and via desktop browser, I finally called D+ support number.

The first call immediately disconnected.

The second call resulted in a long hold time, where I was told my account was on hold and would need to be canceled completely. To the rep's credit, she asked me what had been my process to attempt to update the billing information, and as I was walking her through it, that call also abruptly disconnected.

I finally made another call and also got into the chat queue (25th in line), and I figured I would just talk to whomever answered first.

It was chat.

The chat rep was kind and patient and attempted to empathize, but by the end (even after escalating it), told me the same thing - ""Sorry, we will need to completely cancel your account.""  


**Summary:** For the life of me, I can't imagine why D+ makes it so difficult to give them money. Perhaps it is about the cost to run the servers and maintain accounts, etc. (makes sense), but giving a user less than 24 hours to correct a payment issue seems extreme.

Overall, I have loved my D+ subscription. I was an early adopter, subscribing nearly as soon as the service was available, and yet, this most recent debacle has put a bit of a blemish on the service's reputation, if only through my own eyes.",0,0.33,3,ritual_tradition,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1686355920.0,False,False,False,2023-06-10 00:12:00,tldr after hours of attempting to updated my billing information via the android app then via the a desktop browser then via a phone call to customer service and finally via customer support chat disney plus essentially told me they are not interested in my money full story several weeks ago my credit card was compromised and i began seeing fraudulent charges pop up i contacted my cc issuer and they canceled the card and sent me a new one it was a little annoying especially since i use this cc for nearly all subscriptions but i figured i would just update them as the due dates came around and i received the notifications my d sub was on may and i never received anything and honestly i wasnt tracking it that closely anyway i just knew that at some point i would get the email that said hey please update your billing info that email from d was not a heads up but rather more of a threat see screenshot d threat unfortunately i was traveling at the time and had not been keeping a close eye on email by the time i saw the email about hours after it hit my inbox it was already too late that update payment information request was no longer valid and so began the long arduous trek through the d customer support jungle after multiple attempts to update my payment information via the mobile app and via desktop browser i finally called d support number the first call immediately disconnected the second call resulted in a long hold time where i was told my account was on hold and would need to be canceled completely to the reps credit she asked me what had been my process to attempt to update the billing information and as i was walking her through it that call also abruptly disconnected i finally made another call and also got into the chat queue th in line and i figured i would just talk to whomever answered first it was chat the chat rep was kind and patient and attempted to empathize but by the end even after escalating it told me the same thing sorry we will need to completely cancel your account summary for the life of me i cant imagine why d makes it so difficult to give them money perhaps it is about the cost to run the servers and maintain accounts etc makes sense but giving a user less than hours to correct a payment issue seems extreme overall i have loved my d subscription i was an early adopter subscribing nearly as soon as the service was available and yet this most recent debacle has put a bit of a blemish on the services reputation if only through my own eyes,d cancel your account we dont want your money,1

A Recent Customer Service Experience,"So my wife and I share an account together, and we have one profile. Our account has a pretty strong password and we're security minded usually. Outside of logging in our account in maybe one other place ever we don't share our account information, and we don't share the account with anyone currently. 

Recently we had a new profile pop up on our account. In response we changed the password, logged off all devices from our account using the built-in feature, removed the profile, and logged back in. We figured good enough probably. Guess not. Last week new shows started appearing in the ""recently watched"" section, shows that neither of us had watched. So I went to the customer service chat and tried to figure out if we could get confirmation that the heartbeat functionality had worked. 

Our customer service rep told me to do all the steps I had previously, the only new step was adding a pin to the profile. He told me he has no way of confirming that the process worked. I asked if that meant if it doesn't work, would somebody just have unfettered access to our account? He said Yes. I told him that wasn't good enough, that I would need an escalation. He said no problem and 1 minute later pastes in the same instruction and says ""that's what they said to do"". 

This feels an awful lot like Disney doesn't care at all if my account is unsecured, and then anything attached to my account feels like it's in an unnecessary risk space (credit card info? personal info?). Pursuing escalation to confirm that the security apparatus works results in some L1 tech telling me twice that it's good enough. Am I in the wrong for being worried about account security here?

"Your thoughts on ""The Jungle Book"" (1967)"," 

https://preview.redd.it/cxoiw3stzt4b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a690e3398d5f5d540bac2dfe3af7ed483235e09

**Overview**

Inspired by the Mowgli stories of Rudyard Kipling, *The Jungle Book* has the distinction of being the last animated feature Walt Disney worked on before his death. After suffering some degree of disenchantment with animation and taking a less active role in *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* and *The Sword in the Stone*, Disney seemed to regain some of his old enthusiasm with this latest project, and who knows what that might have led to in the future?

**Point by Point**

* Undertaking this viewing of *The Jungle Book* with a consciously more critical eye, I was surprised right away by how static and lifeless the visuals appeared. Watching all these Disney features in a row like this inevitably invites comparison, and, to be honest, this seems like a step backwards. I'd expected a lot more from a steaming jungle environment. I don't get a sense of the backgrounds teeming with life; Mowgli just seems to be walking through a drawing most of the time. And the animals - especially when compared to those in *Bambi* or *Lady and the Tramp* \- don't seem particularly lifelike. Bagheera, in particular, looks more like a walking sack of flour than a lithe and muscular cat.
* The story starts out pretty slow, too. The characters just aren't very interesting overall. For someone who grew up there, Mowgli seems way too naive about the jungle. He ought to know all about its dangers and its secrets, but, in general, he behaves like he got dropped off just yesterday. I don't care for Sterling Holloway's take on Kaa, and even Shere Khan exhudes far less menace than he did when I was a kid. Things pick up when Baloo enters the picture, and 'The Bare Necessities' has become one of Disney's signature songs. I don't really buy Mowgli and Baloo's relationship becoming so close so quickly, however. It feels inorganic.
* The sequence at the ancient ruins is pretty good, with King Louie singing and dancing, and Baloo disguising himself as an ape, and the fight that ultimately brings down the house. Some scolds have called King Louie a racist caricature of a black man, but that's not what Disney was going for. In fact, they declined to cast Louis Armstrong in the role (and cast white musician Louis Prima) precisely to avoid such accusations.
* The vultures, of course, are based on the Beatles, complete with mop-top haircuts and British accents. Originally the filmmakers had wanted the actual Beatles to voice the vultures, but John Lennon didn't want to do it. Considering that Beatlemania was pretty much at its peak at the time, I can't help but wonder what the reaction in the audience would have been.
* Mowgli being lured back to civilization by his first sight of a pretty girl is a very apt way to end the story. You can't fight nature.

**In Conclusion**

I've seen *The Jungle Book* many times in my life, and I've always enjoyed it well enough, and there's no question that it's become one of Disney's more iconic and beloved stories. But this time it just didn't stick the landing for me; this time I found it rather bland, and lacking in energy. Compared to most of the other Disney movies I've watched during this run so far, it just doesn't pop. To be honest, I think the 2016 remake does just about everything better. Reluctantly, I'm going to have to assign it a lower spot in my ranking.

What's up with Marvel missing properties?,"I'm in Canada. I wanted to watch Runaways for a while. I watched Season 1 and 2 as they were available.

Movies, series, everything)"" I know the shows canonicity is dubious at best but at first they were considered to be a part of the MCU. Anyways, back on track. A couple of weeks later, I stumbled upon an article where they said Runaways was removed from the platform due to budget cuts. What the heck? And what's with other missing properties?

"Your thoughts on ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" (1961)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

At this point in his life, Walt Disney was becoming disenchanted with feature-length animation. *Sleeping Beauty* had been a long, exhausting, and expensive production, and, although Walt had wanted it to become his masterpiece, neither critics nor audiences rewarded him for it. Walt had a soft spot for animation - it had formed the foundation of his company - but he had lots of other irons in the fire now, and he was thinking of just chucking the part of the biz that had begun with *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*. Fortunately for children everywhere, *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* was not only a hit with the public, but had cost much less to produce, largely thanks to the use of Xerox photography. (Imagine having to animate every spot on every dog!) If *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* had not been a success, things today might look very different.

**Point by Point**

* The opening credits sequence is a departure from the norm; playful and lively, with lots of playing into the theme of spots. On the whole, the film's visual style is noticeably distinct from every other feature that had gone before. Where *Snow White* and *Bambi* and *Sleeping Beauty* look like paintings, *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* is more evocative of a newspaper comic strip. Both the backgrounds and the characters are defined by thick, black outlines and angular corners, and some of the scenery even looks like painted cardboard in a stage production. It's a conscious difference in style that really sets the film apart from its predecessors.
* Cruella de Vil bursts onto the scene and immediately takes command of the movie with her loud, bombastic presence. Her stark black-and-white hair, her perpetual scowl, the clouds of sickly green smoke fuming from her cigarette; her exaggerated fur coat that makes her look much bigger than she is, and consequently more threatening. It's no wonder she's become one of the most iconic villains in cinema.
* And appearing again just moments after Perdita has finished delivering her puppies, framed in the doorway by a flash of lightning. Like the summoning of a demon. She's just *there*!
* Jasper and Horace Baddun are effective co-villains with Cruella; bumbling, but nasty and cutthroat, and it's highly satisfying to see them beaten up by Pongo and Perdita during the puppies' spectacular escape from Cruella's old manor house.
* The climactic sequence - in which the Dalmatians disguise themselves as Labradors in order to sneak past Cruella and the Badduns and onto a waiting truck - evokes the proper air of suspense and urgency, and leads straight into an exciting vehicular chase during which Cruella trashes her car and really lets her crazy come out.

**In Conclusion**

*One Hundred and One Dalmatians* is a fun movie with an interesting look and a memorable villain, but it doesn't have as much substance as most other Disney films, and it's pretty anemic in the music department. (Roger's jazzy hit 'Cruella de Vil' is really the only notable number the film has.) And, as a talking dog movie, I'd say it's inferior to *Lady and the Tramp*. It's an important film in the WDAS canon, but I can't rank it among their greatest hits.

I think Disney + will close sooner than we expect,"The signs are already there, as Disney is currently trying to improve its numbers and making decissions.

Yes, sometimes they get it right like with GoTGv3, but they are becoming the exception and not the rule.

Avatar is a juggernaut but Disney + can't rely on a IP that launches 1 product every 5 years. They need more and diverse content... The same content they are cutting.

Is it really Disney + what we need? Or what Disney needs right now? They are better off with putting their content in other streaming services, VOD or physical media formats rather than maintaining the infraestructure of a streaming platform. I don't know a lot about it but it should be very, very expensive.

Most people won't stand more raising prices while they are at the same time deleting content, and I think they know it.

**Overview**

Walt Disney was excited about *Sleeping Beauty*. He envisioned it as his masterpiece. It took almost a decade to produce, and the process cost six million dollars, making it the most expensive Disney animated film yet. It had to struggle through numerous production delays and changes in creative direction, and, when all was said and done, it was a box office failure. But there are a lot of great movies in this world that started out that way and went on to become absolute legends, and *Sleeping Beauty* is one of them.

**Point by Point**

* Naturally, the first aspect of *Sleeping Beauty* that really hits is the visuals. With a tapestry-like art style inspired by pre-Renaissance European art, the distinctive look of *Sleeping Beauty* is the most refined and most detailed yet, with even the backgrounds appearing unique and intricate. I've said before that *Sleeping Beauty* is the *Beauty and the Beast* of its day, it looks that damn good.
* *Sleeping Beauty* is also a standout in the audio department. Most of the film's music is actually adapted from the Tchaikovsky ballet *The Sleeping Beauty*, rather than being wholly original. It wasn't easy to do (George Bruns, the film's composer, spent three years on the project), but it ended up being a tremendously rewarding creative choice.
* The film is striking from the very start, with the bright and colorful introduction set to 'Hail to the Princess Aurora'. It really succeeds in capturing that medieval flavor. Then we meet Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, the three good fairies who will prove central to the plot.
* There can be no question that Maleficent is one of the greatest villains in the Disney canon. Some villains are buffoonish, like Captain Hook. Some are nasty but petty, like Cruella de Vil. Some are pure evil, but tempered with humor, like Hades. And some others - like Scar and Frollo - are sinister and threatening, but pathetic at their core. Maleficent, however, towers above these. She is fearsome and intimidating, regal and commanding, seemingly without weakness of any kind, and evil purely for its own sake.
* Watching the fairies try to prepare for Aurora's sixteenth birthday party - making a dress and a cake, both of which turn out to be abortions - without the aid of magic is always good for a laugh, and it's just as entertaining watching them use their magic once they've finally given up. The former sequence is pure comedy, and the latter sequence provides the thrilling whimsy the audience has come to expect from a Disney movie.
* Watching Aurora strolling through the forest and singing to her animal friends is bound to invite comparison to Snow White and Cinderella, but I think the sequence stands well on its own, and isn't overly derivative. Plus, 'Once Upon a Dream' is easily one of the best Disney songs of its era.
* The 'Skumps' scene, with Stefan and Hubert toasting the imminent marriage of their children, is another good comedic bit. The revelry turns abruptly to an argument, then back to revelry just as quickly. One gets the impression this happens a lot between these two old friends.
* Of course, Aurora isn't dealing well with the sudden revelation that she's a princess by birth and betrothed to a prince, so the fairies make the fatal mistake of leaving her alone in the tower for a few moments. This is the part where *Sleeping Beauty* turns momentarily into a horror movie. Maleficent appears in the shadows of the room like a malign spirit. Without a word, she puts Aurora forcibly into a trance and lures her dreamily from the room, into a dark and desolate part of the castle that appears to have been sealed off and forgotten ages ago. The eerie, ominous music that plays over this sequence makes the proceedings that much more sinister. (Ever tried walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night with this theme playing in your head? I have.)
* King Stefan ordered all spinning wheels destroyed years ago, so Maleficent simply conjures one out of thin air. And with the trance that Aurora is in, she doesn't even have the choice. Maleficent might as well be holding her by the wrist and thrusting her finger onto the spindle herself, it's that forceful. It really drives home the point that there was no avoiding this outcome. It was always going to happen.
* In an ethereal sequence set to the lilting song 'Sleeping Beauty', the good fairies put the entire kingdom to sleep until a solution to Aurora's predicament can be found. When they realize that Prince Phillip can break the curse, they have to go rescue him from Maleficent's lair on the Forbidden Mountain. Maleficent's domain is Gothic and foreboding; grim, twisted, and hellish, with extremely atmospheric music to match.
* Maleficent's triumphal monologue to the imprisoned Phillip really makes clear her utter contempt and loathing for everything pure and good. In a recounting of the situation that's *dripping* with sarcasm, she taunts Phillip with her plan to keep him imprisoned for decades, only to set him free as an old man to finally awaken Aurora, who will still be just a child; to show that ""true love conquers all!"" I don't think that any other Disney villain has been characterized as well as Maleficent is in this single moment.
* Phillip and the fairies' escape from the Forbidden Mountain is an exciting and invigorating sequence, with Phillip fighting back the hordes of devils with his enchanted sword and shield, and the fairies using their powers to turn falling boulders into harmless bubbles and arrows into flowers. And Merryweather finally turning that squawking raven into stone is a triumphant moment in itself.
* They barely manage to escape, but Maleficent is determined that this story won't have a happy ending. She causes a thick forest of thorns to grow up all around Stefan's castle. When Phillip manages to get through even that, she flies to the scene herself. ""Now you deal with me, O Prince, and all the powers of *hell*!"" she cries, as she transforms into an immense, fire-breathing dragon.
* The duel between Phillip and the dragon is the climactic battle between good and evil; between love and hatred. With the forest of thorns burning all around, Phillip has no choice but to seek the high ground atop a cliff, from where the enchanted sword is hurled into the dragon's breast. For a movie that boasted no real action to speak of up until ten minutes ago, *Sleeping Beauty* delivers on excitement.
* After the spectacular fight, everything clears up. The thorns disappear, the sun rises. Phillip kisses Aurora, and everybody wakes up. Aurora and Phillip come down from the tower, happy, not speaking a word, and go out on a dance to 'Once Upon a Dream', with Aurora's gown changing from pink to blue and back again.

**In Conclusion**

There's no doubt that *Sleeping Beauty* is the best film in the line yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if it holds on to that spot at least until we reach the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s. It's so good that it'll doubtless take something like *The Little Mermaid* or *Beauty and the Beast* to topple it from its throne. This truly was Walt's masterpiece.

beauty he envisioned it as his masterpiece it took almost a decade to produce and the process cost six million dollars making it the most expensive disney animated film yet it had to struggle through numerous production delays and changes in creative direction and when all was said and done it was a box office failure but there are a lot of great movies in this world that started out that way and went on to become absolute legends and sleeping beauty is one of them point by point naturally the first aspect of sleeping beauty that really hits is the visuals with a tapestrylike art style inspired by prerenaissance european art the distinctive look of sleeping beauty is the most refined and most detailed yet with even the backgrounds appearing unique and intricate ive said before that sleeping beauty is the beauty and the beast of its day it looks that damn good sleeping beauty is also a standout in the audio department most of the films music is actually adapted from the tchaikovsky ballet the sleeping beauty rather than being wholly original it wasnt easy to do george bruns the films composer spent three years on the project but it ended up being a tremendously rewarding creative choice the film is striking from the very start with the bright and colorful introduction set to hail to the princess aurora it really succeeds in capturing that medieval flavor then we meet flora fauna and merryweather the three good fairies who will prove central to the plot there can be no question that maleficent is one of the greatest villains in the disney canon some villains are buffoonish like captain hook some are nasty but petty like cruella de vil some are pure evil but tempered with humor like hades and some others like scar and frollo are sinister and threatening but pathetic at their core maleficent however towers above these she is fearsome and intimidating regal and commanding seemingly without weakness of any kind and evil purely for its own sake watching the fairies try to prepare for auroras sixteenth birthday party making a dress and a cake both of which turn out to be abortions without the aid of magic is always good for a laugh and its just as entertaining watching them use their magic once theyve finally given up the former sequence is pure comedy and the latter sequence provides the thrilling whimsy the audience has come to expect from a disney movie watching aurora strolling through the forest and singing to her animal friends is bound to invite comparison to snow white and cinderella but i think the sequence stands well on its own and isnt overly derivative plus once upon a dream is easily one of the best disney songs of its era the skumps scene with stefan and hubert toasting the imminent marriage of their children is another good comedic bit the revelry turns abruptly to an argument then back to revelry just as quickly one gets the impression this happens a lot between these two old friends of course aurora isnt dealing well with the sudden revelation that shes a princess by birth and betrothed to a prince so the fairies make the fatal mistake of leaving her alone in the tower for a few moments this is the part where sleeping beauty turns momentarily into a horror movie maleficent appears in the shadows of the room like a malign spirit without a word she puts aurora forcibly into a trance and lures her dreamily from the room into a dark and desolate part of the castle that appears to have been sealed off and forgotten ages ago the eerie ominous music that plays over this sequence makes the proceedings that much more sinister ever tried walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night with this theme playing in your head i have king stefan ordered all spinning wheels destroyed years ago so maleficent simply conjures one out of thin air and with the trance that aurora is in she doesnt even have the choice maleficent might as well be holding her by the wrist and thrusting her finger onto the spindle herself its that forceful it really drives home the point that there was no avoiding this outcome it was always going to happen in an ethereal sequence set to the lilting song sleeping beauty the good fairies put the entire kingdom to sleep until a solution to auroras predicament can be found when they realize that prince phillip can break the curse they have to go rescue him from maleficents lair on the forbidden mountain maleficents domain is gothic and foreboding grim twisted and hellish with extremely atmospheric music to match maleficents triumphal monologue to the imprisoned phillip really makes clear her utter contempt and loathing for everything pure and good in a recounting of the situation thats dripping with sarcasm she taunts phillip with her plan to keep him imprisoned for decades only to set him free as an old man to finally awaken aurora who will still be just a child to show that true love conquers all i dont think that any other disney villain has been characterized as well as maleficent is in this single moment phillip and the fairies escape from the forbidden mountain is an exciting and invigorating sequence with phillip fighting back the hordes of devils with his enchanted sword and shield and the fairies using their powers to turn falling boulders into harmless bubbles and arrows into flowers and merryweather finally turning that squawking raven into stone is a triumphant moment in itself they barely manage to escape but maleficent is determined that this story wont have a happy ending she causes a thick forest of thorns to grow up all around stefans castle when phillip manages to get through even that she flies to the scene herself now you deal with me o prince and all the powers of hell she cries as she transforms into an immense firebreathing dragon the duel between phillip and the dragon is the climactic battle between good and evil between love and hatred with the forest of thorns burning all around phillip has no choice but to seek the high ground atop a cliff from where the enchanted sword is hurled into the dragons breast for a movie that boasted no real action to speak of up until ten minutes ago sleeping beauty delivers on excitement after the spectacular fight everything clears up the thorns disappear the sun rises phillip kisses aurora and everybody wakes up aurora and phillip come down from the tower happy not speaking a word and go out on a dance to once upon a dream with auroras gown changing from pink to blue and back again in conclusion theres no doubt that sleeping beauty is the best film in the line yet and i wouldnt be surprised if it holds on to that spot at least until we reach the disney renaissance of the s its so good that itll doubtless take something like the little mermaid or beauty and the beast to topple it from its throne this truly was walts masterpiece current ranking sleeping beauty lady and the tramp pinocchio bambi cinderella snow white and the

"Your thoughts on ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

Full disclosure: I'm a dog person. I love dogs. They're pretty much my favorite animal, and I have one of my own. So obviously *Lady and the Tramp* is going to hit a bit differently for me than it would for someone who is indifferent to dogs. Interestingly, *Lady and the Tramp* is the first full-length feature in the WDAS canon that wasn't based on a pre-existing story. (Ostensibly, the movie was based on a short story that appeared in *Cosmopolitan* in 1945, entitled ""Happy Dan, the Cynical Dog"", but, having read that story, I can assure you that *Lady and the Tramp* is based on it in the same way that *Frozen* is based on *The Snow Queen*. Which is to say, not at all.)

**Point by Point**

* Lady is an adorable puppy, and you can tell that the Disney animators spent time studying real dogs for their work, because her movements and even her facial expressions (as well as those of the other dogs we'll meet) appear very true to life. Of course, little Lady doesn't want to be left in a room by herself for the night. Dogs aren't solitary creatures, they're pack animals. They want to be with the pack.
* Now Lady is six months old; still a pup, but maturing. She goes to show her shiny new license to her friends and we meet Jock (a Scottish terrier with a Scottish accent) and Trusty (a bloodhound who used to track criminals before he lost his sense of smell). Both are likable support characters.
* Now we transition to Tramp, a mutt living on the streets. He wouldn't usually be hanging out in Lady's affluent neighborhood, but, after springing a couple of friends from the dogcatcher and leading said dogcatcher on a chase, here he is. He interjects himself into a conversation between Lady and her friends about a baby that's coming soon. It's never explicitly stated, but it's still made quite clear that Tramp had a previous bad experience with a family that outgrew him. His warnings to Lady about the baby taking over and ultimately pushing the dog out echo his own misfortunes. He wasn't always a Tramp.
* Lady does have to endure a period during which she's mostly outside the sphere of her family's attention. Shortly after the baby is born, however, and everything has settled down a bit, we see that Jim Dear and Darling (as Lady knows them) are not the same as Tramp's erstwhile owners. When Lady sneaks into the nursery to see what all the fuss is about, she isn't scolded; she isn't seized by the scruff and thrown out. Instead her people pick her up gently and pet her and give her a chance to look at the baby. Clearly she's still part of the family.
* Aunt Sarah, on the other hand, only validates all of Tramp's prejudices against humans. When she comes to babysit, the first thing she does is shoo Lady out of the nursery. Of course, she's a cat person.
* That brings us to the Siamese cats; another problematic racial caricature, on the order of *Dumbo*'s crows and *Peter Pan*'s Indians. They're all slanted eyes, buckteeth, and malevolent intentions. (It's too late to do anything about it now. It is what it is. I'm blowing past it.) They begin causing mischief right away, and Lady tries in vain to stop them. It's when the cats make for the nursery that Lady gets aggressive, though. Most dogs are fiercely protective of their people's children, and Lady doesn't think these two cats should be around the baby.
* Of course, Aunt Sarah blames everything on Lady, and this ultimately leads to Lady becoming muzzled and lost on the streets, where Tramp saves her from a pack of vicious strays.
* The spaghetti and meatballs scene. Not only is it absolutely adorable, but it would be no exaggeration to call it one of the most iconic scenes in cinema.
* After a night of romance, Lady ends up getting snatched by a dogcatcher and taken to the pound. Obviously, the pound is a sad place, and we even see one scruffy boy taking ""the long walk"". It's also here that Lady is told a few choice details about Tramp's many ex-girlfriends.
* After Lady has been returned home (and chained up in the yard by Aunt Sarah), Tramp comes by to try and make up. Lady isn't in the mood, and tells him to leave. Shortly after he does so, Lady spies a big, ugly rat sneaking into the baby's room. Tramp hears her barking and returns, then, without hesitation, runs into the house himself to confront the invading rodent. This demonstrates that Tramp is a good boy. He has no personal stake in this, but he's not going to let the rat hurt the baby. (I've known some sweet, gentle rats in my time, but this particular specimen is a filthy, feral, yellow-eyed bugger, and no good can come of its proximity to a baby.) After a vicious scuffle, during which Tramp sustains a wound on his foot, the rat lays dead.
* Of course, Tramp's reward for his heroism is a ride in the back of the dogcatcher's wagon. Jim Dear and Darling arrive home just as Tramp is being carted away, and, despite Aunt Sarah's misinformed testimony, they're able to see the truth for themselves. Jock and Trusty chase after Tramp and spook the dogcatcher's horses, resulting in the wagon turning over. Even if they hadn't, however, Jim Dear is right behind them in his newfangled automobile. He doesn't want Tramp to be put down undeservedly.
* Now it's Christmas, and Tramp has a new home with Lady's family, and he and Lady have had some cute puppies, and everybody's happy. And Trusty isn't dead, he just busted his leg! That's great!

**In Conclusion**

A cute, happy, heartwarming story about dogs. It may not be Disney's greatest film, or its most beloved, but it's become a classic and a legend all the same. And, during this current run through the WDAS movies, it's the first one to really move me significantly. So, though many would disagree, I'm putting it at the top so far.

"Your thoughts on ""Peter Pan"" (1953)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

As with most of Disney's post-War projects, *Peter Pan* had actually been in the works, in one form or another, for quite a long time. Disney had purchased the film rights to the story all the way back in 1938, but World War II happened, and Disney's animated projects were set back almost a decade. As only the second cinema adaptation of the story (the first was a 1924 silent film which stayed largely faithful to J.M. Barrie's original play), Disney was the first entity to really put its own spin on Peter and Neverland.

**Point by Point**

* We open on the bustling Darling household in London, with Mr. and Mrs. Darling preparing for a night out amidst the chaos of John and Michael playing pirates in the nursery. Mr. Darling, despite being the heavy (or perhaps because of that), is a rich font of comedy. Incidentally, in performances of J.M. Barrie's play, it's considered traditional for the roles of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook to be played by the same actor. I think it's neat that Disney carried that tradition over.
* Peter Pan's entry as a spritely, agile figure on the Darling's shadowy rooftop, to the accompaniment of flute music, is a good one, presenting him as sort of mysterious and enigmatic. This is likely also the first time in *Peter Pan*'s history that Tinker Bell had been portrayed as something more than just a blob of light. Being able to see her facial expressions and read her body language really adds a lot of depth to her character. Barrie's play *tells* us that Tinker Bell is angry and jealous of Wendy, but this movie *shows* us.
* Peter and the children flying through the night sky over London, to the tune of 'You Can Fly!', is one of the best parts of the movie, I think. Tinker Bell deliberately skips through Wendy's reflection in the river. It's adorable watching her be such a pouty little bitch.
* Something odd that I noticed this time. As we meet the pirates for the first time, they're throwing knives idly at a crude drawing on the wall labeled ""The Cap'n"". Thing is, the drawing has *two* hands. Why would the pirates draw The Cap'n with *two* hands?
* Captain Hook is a colorful, flamboyant villain; cowardly, but stylish; a memorable addition to the pantheon of Disney antagonists. His obsession with Peter Pan is made all the clearer by the evident dissatisfaction of his crew; they're sick of hanging around in Neverland and want to go to sea, but Hook is dead set on defeating Pan first.
* Peter Pan really does act like a boy. He's not an adult character disguised as a child, he genuinely is a child. Take his behavior at Mermaid Lagoon, for example. He flies down there by himself and immediately begins bragging to the mermaids about his adventures, leaving Wendy to climb awkwardly down. Then, when the mermaids attack Wendy, he just laughs. He intervenes only when it looks as though Wendy is about to brain one of them with a conch shell. Point is, he's not particularly chivalrous or considerate. He's just a kid.
* This is followed by a pretty good sequence showcasing the seething antagonism between Peter and Hook. With both action and comedy, Peter rescues Tiger Lily and Hook almost ends up as Crocodile food.
* The Indians are unflattering racial caricatures, there's no denying that. They're buffoonish, mostly ugly, wild in every sense of the word, and they're as red as fire engines. But, when all's said and done, they aren't really meant to be accurate depictions of Native Americans. Neverland, as conceived by J.M. Barrie, is a fantasyland for boys, full of things that boys back then were enamored of. To young boys in Barrie's time, Indians weren't disenfranchised victims of colonialism and genocide; they represented adventure and independence and the great outdoors. Mom and Dad got you down? Run away and live with the Indians! I'm not saying that their portrayal in this film is justified; just that there's a certain context to it.
* In the play, Tinker Bell saves Peter's life by drinking poison, then is revived by the heartfelt applause of the audience. But you can't really do that with a movie. So here the glass of poison is replaced with a time bomb, which Tinker Bell carries out of Peter's hands just in time. Tinker Bell is weakened by the explosion, but is able to regain her strength.
* The battle on the pirate ship is quite the exciting finale, especially when Peter and Hook duel up in the rigging. Of course, Peter defeats Hook, after which Hook begs for mercy. Peter grants said mercy, only for Hook to try and literally stab him in the back. This moment of the hero's mercy being thrown back in his face recurs in later Disney features such as *Beauty and the Beast*, *The Lion King*, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, and *Tarzan*. The moral of the story seems clear; never show your enemy mercy.
* In the play, Peter and his friends use the pirate ship to sail the seas back to London. In this movie, Tinker Bell drenches the whole damn ship with pixie dust, and they *fly* it back to London. An extravagant tweaking of the original material, which is Disney's specialty.

**In Conclusion**

Another triumphant adaptation by Disney. It doesn't do anything new on the technical side of things, and the song catalog is a bit weak, but it's full of fun and adventure and colorful characters. For now I'm going to stick it between *Alice in Wonderland* and *Dumbo*.

peter pan had actually been in the works in one form or another for quite a long time disney had purchased the film rights to the story all the way back in but world war ii happened and disneys animated projects were set back almost a decade as only the second cinema adaptation of the story the first was a silent film which stayed largely faithful to jm barries original play disney was the first entity to really put its own spin on peter and neverland point by point we open on the bustling darling household in london with mr and mrs darling preparing for a night out amidst the chaos of john and michael playing pirates in the nursery mr darling despite being the heavy or perhaps because of that is a rich font of comedy incidentally in performances of jm barries play its considered traditional for the roles of mr darling and captain hook to be played by the same actor i think its neat that disney carried that tradition over peter pans entry as a spritely agile figure on the darlings shadowy rooftop to the accompaniment of flute music is a good one presenting him as sort of mysterious and enigmatic this is likely also the first time in peter pans history that tinker bell had been portrayed as something more than just a blob of light being able to see her facial expressions and read her body language really adds a lot of depth to her character barries play tells us that tinker bell is angry and jealous of wendy but this movie shows us peter and the children flying through the night sky over london to the tune of you can fly is one of the best parts of the movie i think tinker bell deliberately skips through wendys reflection in the river its adorable watching her be such a pouty little bitch something odd that i noticed this time as we meet the pirates for the first time theyre throwing knives idly at a crude drawing on the wall labeled the capn thing is the drawing has two hands why would the pirates draw the capn with two hands captain hook is a colorful flamboyant villain cowardly but stylish a memorable addition to the pantheon of disney antagonists his obsession with peter pan is made all the clearer by the evident dissatisfaction of his crew theyre sick of hanging around in neverland and want to go to sea but hook is dead set on defeating pan first peter pan really does act like a boy hes not an adult character disguised as a child he genuinely is a child take his behavior at mermaid lagoon for example he flies down there by himself and immediately begins bragging to the mermaids about his adventures leaving wendy to climb awkwardly down then when the mermaids attack wendy he just laughs he intervenes only when it looks as though wendy is about to brain one of them with a conch shell point is hes not particularly chivalrous or considerate hes just a kid this is followed by a pretty good sequence showcasing the seething antagonism between peter and hook with both action and comedy peter rescues tiger lily and hook almost ends up as crocodile food the indians are unflattering racial caricatures theres no denying that theyre buffoonish mostly ugly wild in every sense of the word and theyre as red as fire engines but when alls said and done they arent really meant to be accurate depictions of native americans neverland as conceived by jm barrie is a fantasyland for boys full of things that boys back then were enamored of to young boys in barries time indians werent disenfranchised victims of colonialism and genocide they represented adventure and independence and the great outdoors mom and dad got you down run away and live with the indians im not saying that their portrayal in this film is justified just that theres a certain context to it in the play tinker bell saves peters life by drinking poison then is revived by the heartfelt applause of the audience but you cant really do that with a movie so here the glass of poison is replaced with a time bomb which tinker bell carries out of peters hands just in time tinker bell is weakened by the explosion but is able to regain her strength the battle on the pirate ship is quite the exciting finale especially when peter and hook duel up in the rigging of course peter defeats hook after which hook begs for mercy peter grants said mercy only for hook to try and literally stab him in the back this moment of the heros mercy being thrown back in his face recurs in later disney features such as beauty and the beast the lion king the hunchback of notre dame and tarzan the moral of the story seems clear never show your enemy mercy in the play peter and his friends use the pirate ship to sail the seas back to london in this movie tinker bell drenches the whole damn ship with pixie dust and they fly it back to london an extravagant tweaking of the original material which is disneys specialty in conclusion another triumphant adaptation by disney it doesnt do anything new on the technical side of things and the song catalog is a bit weak but its full of fun and adventure and colorful characters for now im going to stick it between alice in wonderland and dumbo current ranking pinocchio bambi cinderella snow white and the seven dwarfs alice in wonderland peter pan dumbo the adventures of ichabod and mr toad fantasia melody time fun and fancy free the three caballeros make mine music saludos amigos,your thoughts

Futurama on Disney+ (Czechia),"So I noticed there is Futurama on Czech Disney+ but it's quite weirdly spanning across 9 seasons instead of 7 and has 127 episodes instead of 140.

Could someone clarify whether this is normal? Does anyone have experience with it?

Howard - Howard Ashman doc,"I’m so glad this got a reprieve. I watched it today and enjoyed it immensely and learned a lot as well. The last quarter or so is very sad as it covers his illness and the race to complete what he could. I didn’t realize they were bringing work to him in the hospital. I knew he had died before the Oscars when Beauty and the Beast was nominated but I thought he at least made it til the release of the movie.

Loved the recreation of his childhood playtime with his sister, all the 60s and 70s background, and the glimpses of the plays he helped put on. I especially loved all the behind the scenes footage of the creation of Little Mermaid and BATB. The scenes of Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury (RIP x 2) were delightful.

This doc made me want to watch all three of the Disney movies that Ashman had a hand in, as well as the 1986 Little Shop of Horrors movie, which I never have seen.

It may be weird of saying this... But I'm really going to miss Fairy Tale Weddings.,"When I heard this was amongst the many shows set to be taken off the service, I had to catch some of the show while I still can after watching that Willow reboot. Honestly, this was something I never thought I would find myself watching a lot of all that much when I first started watching it out of curiosity a few years back. Maybe it was just to have something playing in the background but it was some entertaining stuff, even if the hosts tend to be rather cringy from time to time.

There was just something about seeing the proposals be planned out and performed and see the titular weddings go on after they've been planned out as well. It tends to have that sort of feel good thing going on when seeing all these engaged couples enjoy themselves and embracing one another. And that third episode in the second season really does have a lot more emotion put to it when it comes to the bride and groom's backstories regarding their brothers along with that Flash mob proposal.

I don't know if this was something that can still be watched on Hulu or Freeform or whatever but one thing's for sure is that it'll suck a whole dang lot having this be one to be removed from the service as well.

What were people's thoughts on the Willow reboot series after all these years?,"Between hearing about its cancellation and it being one of many shows that were set to be removed from the service starting tomorrow, I thought it would've been best to try to finish the rest of it before than. Probably should've done so sooner instead of doing it at the last day. 

I stopped watching it when new episodes were still airing for various reasons ranging from having other shows premiere around the same time, to stuff within the show itself like the pacing of the show being a bit too long for my liking, all the romance subplots, some of the characters being more annoying than they should be, and more especially I think the soundtrack used for this.

Now seven and a half episodes in I find the show to be confusing plot wise, a bit too long thanks to some of the subplots in it, some of the characters, including the new female ones being more aggravating at times and meh at others, and the soundtrack is still just plain ridiculously questionable. I mean half of the time, it is befitting to that of the original more and what have you but other times, it's just so baffling as to why they thought it best to use a more modern sounding soundtrack in this. It contrasts so much with the fantasy setting that it just takes me out of the whole thing more each time it plays something not of those times. And people complain about the Super Mario movie doing this; at least that handled them better. 

Not to mention being more tonally consistent; this just tries too hard being funny when it can't seem to have a knack of having a balance between being more funny and more serious when it's needed.

Now I approach the high and final episode I feel like some things are done well, especially visually, audits certainly nice seeing some old favorites return here, especial Warrick Davis. But honestly... I'm more conflicted with this. It's sucks that itgot cancelled and will be removed from the service but overall... I'm just more mixed about this show overall.

What's the point of a streaming service if a lot of its original content can be removed for the dumbest reasons possible?,"With tomorrow being the day when so much stuff from both Disney Plus and Hulu are set to be removed from both of them, I begin to question this the more the months go on. What with them increasing the prices on both services and them potentially planning on finally merging the two platforms into one, hopefully without closing down one for the other, it really makes one wonder if these cost cutting measures are really necessary for companies that are worth billions of dollars. 

Yeah some shows and movies may not be watched by many and others are about as unknown as they can get and they were THIS CLOSE to disrespecting one of the most important factors in the Disney Renaissance by removing one of their documentaries about him from the service...

 **Overview**

Ah, what a breath of fresh air! Hitler is dead and Disney has a bit of money back in the bank, so it's time to return to the full-length masterpieces we all know and love. And *Cinderella*, with its iconic characters, music, and imagery, is the perfect way to start off this new era! Though the archetypal Cinderella story is thousands of years old, this film takes its inspiration mainly from Charles Perrault, whose 1697 rendition of the tale originated many of the things we associate with Cinderella today, including the pumpkin coach, the glass slippers, the fairy godmother, and even the name Cinderella.

**Point by Point**

* The credits sequence, though a simple listing of the talent, is beautiful and dignified, and is accompanied by the lilting song 'Cinderella'. Then, of course, the traditional storybook intro. Gosh, it's good to be back.
* Cinderella is an exquisite reincarnation of Snow White, embodying the same sympathy and grace, and with the same rapport with animals (particularly the chateau's many mice, whom she names and dresses herself). Like Snow White, it's easy to feel protective of her right away. Immediately we get a sense of how busy she is, slaving away for her contemptuous step-family.
* The stepmother (whose name is given as Lady Tremaine) is just an old lady, whose domain begins and ends with this meager household, and yet she's as intimidating and as despicable as any other Disney villain. Props to the animators, writers, and voice actress for elevating this comparatively minor antagonist to the heights of Maleficent, Ursula, and Jafar.
* A lot can be said about Cinderella's stepmother, but she must truly, genuinely love her biological daughters. Only a mother's love would be blind to how homely, graceless, and talentless the stepsisters are, let alone believe for a moment that either one of them is capable of charming a prince. It is said in the introduction that Lady Tremaine is jealous and resentful of Cinderella because of how bad the beautiful and graceful girl makes her own daughters look by comparison, and this contrast is really pushed in our face during the music lesson. Anastasia and Drizella are hopeless at carrying a tune, while Cinderella - scrubbing the floor downstairs - performs it for herself perfectly.
* It's fun watching the mice and the bluebirds assemble a dress for Cinderella to wear to the ball, and it's heartrending watching the spiteful stepsisters tear it to pieces. Everything feels like it's going to be all right when the Fairy Godmother shows up, of course. The 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' sequence is a joyful pick-me-up after the tremendous downer we just witnessed, and watching the Fairy Godmother transform the pumpkin and the animals and, at last, Cinderella's dress, is a highlight of the film.
* The brief romantic sequence between Cinderella and the Prince, dancing at the ball to the tune of 'So This Is Love', is nice, and Cinderella's rush to escape at the stroke of midnight is exciting and suspenseful.
* Another sequence of suspense comes when Lady Tremaine - suddenly suspicious of Cinderella - locks her in her tower bedroom while the Grand Duke is visiting to try the glass slipper on the two stepsisters. Though it's an ordeal, Cinderella's animal friends manage to free her just in time for her to run downstairs and meet the Duke. The stepmother, of course, is so petty and vindictive that she actually trips the Duke's servant carrying the glass slipper, resulting in its destruction. What a swell of triumph, then, when Cinderella reveals to the weeping Duke and the astonished stepmother that the other slipper is right there in her possession.

**In Conclusion**

As with Disney's prior storybook adaptations, *Cinderella* is a triumph of the art form, full of fun and emotion, visually and musically pleasing, and a classic that endures to this day. An excellent return to form.

Disney+ could be the hub of all things Disney instead of a stack of old DVD's,"Quality of content aside, Disney has a ton of new movies and TV shows coming to the service.  I remember the days when a new Pixar film would be a massive event.  A new Indiana Jones movie is coming out and yet I barely knew it was releasing in cinemas.  Disney is supposed to be adding Indy to the service, but it seems in general shows just poop out on to the service with a whimper.

Yet if you go to Youtube there is weekly shows, red carpet events and all sorts of buzz (good and bad) about Disney's projects.  Who is the customer that is going to see these Disney films in cinema?  It's the Disney+ subscribers!  Why isn't there any hype at all on the app?

While we are on the subject it is an app, a online thing that can adapt and change, and yet since launch it looks largely the same.  Why can't the app speak to the Disney Store Online for merch, why can't the app let you buy Cinema tickets through it?  Imagine after the Indy tab is launched and you see all the exciting stuff for the new film and it allows you buy a family ticket right there.  And maybe you get a themed popcorn bucket or something as well.

While I am buying tickets why not get an Indiana Jones t-shirt off the Disney Store right from the app? It arrives in the post in time for me don it at the cinema.

Imagine if your Disney classic film collection tiles could be DVD boxes instead?  How cool would it be to browse through your collection of films like a digital DVD shelf.  

I live in the UK and Disney has a theme park and cruise ships.  Why aren't those promoted more?  Who doesn't love those discovery channel style documentaries of the cruise ships.  How about booking your next holiday through the Disney+ App?  Why not have more live content from the parks.

When Disney was experimenting with Disney+ in the UK it was called Disney Life.  It including music you could listen to, Radio Disney, it included a 10% discount in the Disney Store.  They had classic audio books for kids.  Disney Life was more then just a stack of DVD's.  It was a whole of Disney experience. 

Anyway Disney+ could do a lot through presentation and cross-promotion in the app making you want to check it everyday for what is new and exciting.  

Now the front page is a mix of Peter Pan from a film I never heard of nor care about and some 18 rated show and some dramas I could care less about. 

Basically there is no magic.  They need to add visual magic into the app to excite customers and make a one stop shop for all things Disney.",13,0.82,7,Nintendad47,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1684853251.0,False,False,False,2023-05-23 14:47:31,quality of content aside disney has a ton of new movies and tv shows coming to the service i remember the days when a new pixar film would be a massive event a new indiana jones movie is coming out and yet i barely knew it was releasing in cinemas disney is supposed to be adding indy to the service but it seems in general shows just poop out on to the service with a whimper yet if you go to youtube there is weekly shows red carpet events and all sorts of buzz good and bad about disneys projects who is the customer that is going to see these disney films in cinema its the disney subscribers why isnt there any hype at all on the app while we are on the subject it is an app a online thing that can adapt and change and yet since launch it looks largely the same why cant the app speak to the disney store online for merch why cant the app let you buy cinema tickets through it imagine after the indy tab is launched and you see all the exciting stuff for the new film and it allows you buy a family ticket right there and maybe you get a themed popcorn bucket or something as well while i am buying tickets why not get an indiana jones tshirt off the disney store right from the app it arrives in the post in time for me don it at the cinema imagine if your disney classic film collection tiles could be dvd boxes instead how cool would it be to browse through your collection of films like a digital dvd shelf i live in the uk and disney has a theme park and cruise ships why arent those promoted more who doesnt love those discovery channel style documentaries of the cruise ships how about booking your next holiday through the disney app why not have more live content from the parks when disney was experimenting with disney in the uk it was called disney life it including music you could listen to radio disney it included a discount in the disney store they had classic audio books for kids disney life was more then just a stack of dvds it was a whole of disney experience anyway disney could do a lot through presentation and crosspromotion in the app making you want to check it everyday for what is new and exciting now the front page is a mix of peter pan from a film i never heard of nor care about and some rated show and some dramas i could care less about basically there is no magic they need to add visual magic into the app to excite customers and make a one stop shop for all things disney,disney could be the hub of all things disney instead of a stack of old dvds,1
"Your thoughts on ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" (1949)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0zpl2itypj1b1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74569a01a2c48f555d33f85f728d977ceebead9b

 **Overview**

The final package film of the 1940s, and you know I haven't been a fan of these so far, but *The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad* is actually quite good, with two segments that honor Disney's creative legacy and show signs of them getting back on track. Split into *The Wind in the Willows* (narrated by Basil Rathbone) and *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow* (narrated by Bing Crosby), the film is whimsical and well-made, with greater depth and artistry than we've seen in some time.

**Point by Point**

* Straight off the bat, the visuals are better than your standard *Silly Symphony* or Donald Duck cartoon. The action in some of the prior anthologies seems slapdash and low-grade, but the sequence with Toad rampaging through the English countryside with his horse and cart is buttery smooth, and the same can be said of the later set pieces that take place during Toad's escape from prison and the attack on the weasel-infested Toad Hall. Really, the difference in quality of animation between this and something like *Make Mine Music* is like night and day.
* Where *The Wind in the Willows* is fully voice acted, *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow* is done in pantomime, with more songs. I admit I have nostalgia for this one, as it was traditional viewing in my household every Halloween night when I was a kid. Even without rose-colored glasses, however, I think the rounded characters, thoughtful writing, quality animation, and catchy music still set it above most other short features Disney had turned out at this point.
* As with *The Wind in the Willows*, the characters of *Sleepy Hollow* are more fleshed out than the comparative stick figures populating the segments of prior anthologies. Ichabod Crane is at once snobbish, superstitious, a lover of good food, and inexplicably attractive to women, although he's principally concerned with what he can get from them. Even after falling in love with the wealthy Katrina van Tassel, he's equally as infatuated with her family fortune.
* Katrina gives Ichabod the time of day, but it's clear she's just using him as a foil for Brom Bones (a sort of forebear of *Beauty and the Beast*'s Gaston). She wants to flirt around and play coy, but Ichabod is the only man in the village who isn't intimidated into submission by Brom. The sequence in which we see Ichabod consistently defeat Brom (mostly by accident) as he courts Katrina is good comedy.
* The dance sequence with the overly eager woman at van Tassel's Halloween party is a good bit of raucous comedy amidst the lower-key proceedings. The song 'The Headless Horseman', performed afterwards, is one of the highlights of the feature.
* The sequence of Ichabod riding home through the dark forest, with nothing but the Headless Horseman on his mind, is appropriately bleak and foreboding, and the tension picks up as every sound around him conspires to terrorize him further. Finally, when the tension breaks, and Ichabod realizes he's jumping at shadows, and he begins to laugh madly at what a fool he's been, it really does seem like that's that. See what happens when you let your imagination run away with you, kiddies? There's no such thing as ghosts. Don't be a nervous fool like our friend Ichabod.
* Oh, wait, ghosts are real! Yes, seemingly out of nowhere, the Headless Horseman materializes and a thrilling chase ensues. In the end, Ichabod's fate is left ambiguous. He did get across that bridge, after all, even if he did take a flaming pumpkin to the head. Maybe he woke up in the mud a few minutes later and decided to leave right away for parts unknown, or...maybe the Headless Horseman got him after all.

**In Conclusion**

There's no denying it's been a rough decade for Disney features, what with Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi being supplanted by the likes of Bongo, Pecos Bill, and anthropomorphic mail planes and tugboats. The two segments contained within *The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad* are undeniably good, however, and remain classics to this day in their own right. At least we're capping this era on a high note. And now that Disney finally has the time and resources to get back to reinventing the wheel with animated fairy tale epics, what's next on the docket? *Cinderella*, of course!

"My Dr. Doom, Disney+ Series....thoughts? Input? Suggestions? (Fan-made / Fan-fiction)","  

Please bare with me…this is a long read

Intro:

So, I am finalizing a series of scripts that is a story about my favorite Marvel character of all time...Victor Von Doom! I'm doing this as practice to refine my script-writing skills. I would LOVE for this to be a reality, however. I know that's a long shot. I'm posting an overall synopsis here, just to gather thoughts and feedback.

Background on how my version of DOOM fits in the MCU:

After the Infinity Gauntlet phases, I felt the need to go in another direction for MCU. With Thanos, Marvel gradually teased him throughout the phase which culminated with Thanos’ story being fully fleshed out in the last 2 Avengers movies. With my version of Doom, I thought it would be best if Marvel / Disney introduced him first through a Disney+ series. This series would explore Doom’s motivations, backstory and skills so that we could later see his handiwork in all future movies and shows. It could be in post-credits scenes or sprinkled within the future shows and movies which would culminate with an epic showdown with. Doom himself.

THE RISE OF DOOM (series title)

The story would begin with Victor as a child. Victor is an olive skinned Roma (Gypsy) and an extremely bright young man with a natural gifts for strategy and robotics. He is self-taught and boast an extreme ego, even as a child.

As the series opens, we see a young Victor walking through the streets of Latveria. The area he lives is within the slums and Victor himself is dressed in ragged attire. For fun, Victor plays chess with elderly citizens and also performs magic to impress the local girls. The magic he performs is not slight of hand, but actual magic, which he learned from his mother.

When Victor arrives home we meet two other crucial characters, his mother and his “pet”. His “pet” is a crudely designed yet sophisticated robot, which Victor himself created. It is a masterpiece of robotic technology fueled by magical source, which he had harnessed in a crude fashion. The robot is also a source of comedic relief within the series.

At home, we see Victor’s close relationship with his single mother. She teaches him traditions, magic and kindness yet they struggle with the current political climate within Latveria. There is much unrest in the country, due to rising racism against the Roma (Gypsy) people. This is all subtle for the time being.

Fast forward to Victor now being a college age young man. He is extremely attractive and very flirtatious with the local girls, yet too engrossed in his quest for knowledge and robotics to become involved with any of them. He gets home to discover his mother happy and excited with news to share. Victor. Has been accepted to MIT, full scholarship in robotics! Victor is ecstatic, yet hesitant to leave his mother due to rising tensions against the Roma people within Latveria. His mother reassures him that everything will be alright and lovingly supports him to chase his dreams of attending college in the United States. Victor eventually agrees.

COLLEGE:

Victor leaves Latveria and travels to the United States. He is almost an immediate celebrity in college due to his good looks, self-confidence, brilliant mind and exotic accent. In college he meets another brilliant student named Reed Richards. As Victor is extremely competitive, he instantly views Reed as his “competition” and strives to out-do him in every facet.

Contrary to Victor, Reed is extremely kind-hearted and tries to befriend Victor. Victor is much to egocentric and competitive to accept this. While Victor’s specialty is in robotics, Reed’s expertise is in physics and biology. Victor pushes to better himself in an attempt to remain competitive with Reed. In fact, his need to outshine Richards takes priority over almost all else. As Victor’s college life continues, he begins to get increasingly stressed. News reports from Latveria is reporting that an eccentric leader, named Tiger Wylde, has taken political control of the country and has begun to create an apartheid state against the Roma people.

As tensions continue, Victor becomes increasingly stressed and his performance suffers. Reed attempts to help and befriend him, yet Victor’s ego will not allow it. The final straw comes as news from Latveria reports that Tiger Wylde has begun rounding up the Roma people. At this same time, Victor is teamed up with Reed for an important mid-term chemistry project. During the project, Victor is not himself and is making many uncharacteristic mistakes. Reed tries to warn him, but Victor will not listen. Torn by his personal conflicts, worry about his mother and his unnecessary competitive attitude towards Reed, Victor makes a mistake causing an explosion that gives him a cut on his cheek.

Victor is enraged and blames the situation entirely on Reed. Since he can no longer contact his mother, Victor drops out of college and returns to Latveria. When he arrives, he finds out his mother has been taken by the state. Victor further improves his “pet” robot and makes it an intense machine, a mixture of robotics and magic. He also builds a magical infused robotic mask to hide his face. This covers his scar (which is not that bad, but his vanity causes him to see it as terrible) and allows him to remain anonymous as he strategizes how to save his mother. During the creation process, the mask had not finished properly cooling and Victor puts in on. The hot metal sears his flesh and the mask is permanently grafted to his skin. Victor finds local residents who are not happy with the apartheid state their nation has become.

Victor attempts to rescue his mother, but by the time he reaches her she is already dead. This causes him to snap. He is no longer Victor after this moment, he has become DOOM! He joins a local resistance movement and begins to help them strategize a revolution. He uses his skill in robotics and magic, and creates the first, crudely built, Doombots to help in the insurrection.

At first, Victor and his forces are defeated badly by Tiger Wylde and his forces. Victor befriends several of his fellow revolutionaries and manages to escape. Once escaped, he focuses and begins to perfect his Doombots, creating a formidable army.

The combined forces of Doom, Victor and the patriotic citizens manages to overthrow the government and kill Dictator Wylde in an epic showdown.

Once defeated, we see Doom assume the throne of Latveria. He mercilessly kills the apartheid supporters and begins to instantly create a better life for the people of Latveria. He is beloved by all the citizens. Now, as the leader of a nation on the world stage, Doom sits in his iconic throne and begins to strategize his next objective…..the world!

BONUS EPISODE: (based on Amazing Spiderman #350)

After the series has officially ended, an unexpected bonus episode is released. In this episode, we are taken to New York where a friendly neighborhood Spiderman is swinging around. Spiderman hears alarms sounding in the distance which are coming from the New York museum. As he investigates, he discovers Doom in the museum. He is stealing an artifact, that we see earlier in the series, which belonged to his mother. It is a magical artifact that was stolen from his mother and smuggled out of the country during the apartheid and rounding up of the Roma people.

Spiderman attempts to stop Doom, but is easily outmatched (see the comic reference). Doom easily defeats our friendly neighborhood Spiderman, and leaves with the relic. This episode introduces Doom to the larger Marvel universe while showcasing his power. As the episode concludes, a badly battered Spiderman is reporting this new threat to Earth’s heroes, while Doom begins to interact with the relic. The relic itself, is much more powerful and important than anyone realizes!

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

As a lifelong comic book fan, and Dr. Doom superfan, much of the imagery in my mind is scenes directly from the comic. Iconic imagery which pays homage to Marvel’s past artists and comic book fans alike.

about my favorite marvel character of all timevictor von doom im doing this as practice to refine my scriptwriting skills i would love for this to be a reality however i know thats a long shot im posting an overall synopsis here just to gather thoughts and feedback background on how my version of doom fits in the mcu after the infinity gauntlet phases i felt the need to go in another direction for mcu with thanos marvel gradually teased him throughout the phase which culminated with thanos story being fully fleshed out in the last avengers movies with my version of doom i thought it would be best if marvel disney introduced him first through a disney series this series would explore dooms motivations backstory and skills so that we could later see his handiwork in all future movies and shows it could be in postcredits scenes or sprinkled within the future shows and movies which would culminate with an epic showdown with doom himself the rise of doom series title the story would begin with victor as a child victor is an olive skinned roma gypsy and an extremely bright young man with a natural gifts for strategy and robotics he is selftaught and boast an extreme ego even as a child as the series opens we see a young victor walking through the streets of latveria the area he lives is within the slums and victor himself is dressed in ragged attire for fun victor plays chess with elderly citizens and also performs magic to impress the local girls the magic he performs is not slight of hand but actual magic which he learned from his mother when victor arrives home we meet two other crucial characters his mother and his pet his pet is a crudely designed yet sophisticated robot which victor himself created it is a masterpiece of robotic technology fueled by magical source which he had harnessed in a crude fashion the robot is also a source of comedic relief within the series at home we see victors close relationship with his single mother she teaches him traditions magic and kindness yet they struggle with the current political climate within latveria there is much unrest in the country due to rising racism against the roma gypsy people this is all subtle for the time being fast forward to victor now being a college age young man he is extremely attractive and very flirtatious with the local girls yet too engrossed in his quest for knowledge and robotics to become involved with any of them he gets home to discover his mother happy and excited with news to share victor has been accepted to mit full scholarship in robotics victor is ecstatic yet hesitant to leave his mother due to rising tensions against the roma people within latveria his mother reassures him that everything will be alright and lovingly supports him to chase his dreams of attending college in the united states victor eventually agrees college victor leaves latveria and travels to the united states he is almost an immediate celebrity in college due to his good looks selfconfidence brilliant mind and exotic accent in college he meets another brilliant student named reed richards as victor is extremely competitive he instantly views reed as his competition and strives to outdo him in every facet contrary to victor reed is extremely kindhearted and tries to befriend victor victor is much to egocentric and competitive to accept this while victors specialty is in robotics reeds expertise is in physics and biology victor pushes to better himself in an attempt to remain competitive with reed in fact his need to outshine richards takes priority over almost all else as victors college life continues he begins to get increasingly stressed news reports from latveria is reporting that an eccentric leader named tiger wylde has taken political control of the country and has begun to create an apartheid state against the roma people as tensions continue victor becomes increasingly stressed and his performance suffers reed attempts to help and befriend him yet victors ego will not allow it the final straw comes as news from latveria reports that tiger wylde has begun rounding up the roma people at this same time victor is teamed up with reed for an important midterm chemistry project during the project victor is not himself and is making many uncharacteristic mistakes reed tries to warn him but victor will not listen torn by his personal conflicts worry about his mother and his unnecessary competitive attitude towards reed victor makes a mistake causing an explosion that gives him a cut on his cheek victor is enraged and blames the situation entirely on reed since he can no longer contact his mother victor drops out of college and returns to latveria when he arrives he finds out his mother has been taken by the state victor further improves his pet robot and makes it an intense machine a mixture of robotics and magic he also builds a magical infused robotic mask to hide his face this covers his scar which is not that bad but his vanity causes him to see it as terrible and allows him to remain anonymous as he strategizes how to save his mother during the creation process the mask had not finished properly cooling and victor puts in on the hot metal sears his flesh and the mask is permanently grafted to his skin victor finds local residents who are not happy with the apartheid state their nation has become victor attempts to rescue his mother but by the time he reaches her she is already dead this causes him to snap he is no longer victor after this moment he has become doom he joins a local resistance movement and begins to help them strategize a revolution he uses his skill in robotics and magic and creates the first crudely built doombots to help in the insurrection at first victor and his forces are defeated badly by tiger wylde and his forces victor befriends several of his fellow revolutionaries and manages to escape once escaped he focuses and begins to perfect his doombots creating a formidable army the combined forces of doom victor and the patriotic citizens manages to overthrow the government and kill dictator wylde in an epic showdown once defeated we see doom assume the throne of latveria he mercilessly kills the apartheid supporters and begins to instantly create a better life for the people of latveria he is beloved by all the citizens now as the leader of a nation on the world stage doom sits in his iconic throne and begins to strategize his next objectivethe world bonus episode based on amazing spiderman after the series has officially ended an unexpected bonus episode is released in this episode we are taken to new york where a friendly neighborhood spiderman is swinging around spiderman hears alarms sounding in the distance which are coming from the new york museum as he investigates he discovers doom in the museum he is stealing an artifact that we see earlier in the series which belonged to his mother it is a magical artifact that was stolen from his mother and smuggled out of the country during the apartheid and rounding up of the roma people spiderman attempts to stop doom but is easily outmatched see the comic reference doom easily defeats our friendly neighborhood spiderman and leaves with the relic this episode introduces doom to the larger marvel universe while showcasing his power as the episode concludes a badly battered spiderman is reporting this new threat to earths heroes while doom begins to interact with the relic the relic itself is much more powerful and important than anyone realizes additional notes as a

"Your thoughts on ""Melody Time"" (1948)","&#x200B;

**Overview**

*Melody Time* follows in the same vein as *Make Mine Music*, presenting a series of short, unrelated cartoons, each set to a piece of music or a ballad. Overall, it's a cut above *Make Mine Music* and the other anthology films we've seen so far. The material is more diverse and more interesting, and the production values at least appear higher. Still, I just want to get back to beautiful, groundbreaking features like *Snow White* and *Bambi*.

**Point by Point**

* The opening feature, *Once Upon a Wintertime*, is nice enough. An inoffensive, fluffy piece with some cute characters. *Bumble Boogie*, set to a swing-jazz variation of 'Flight of the Bumblebee', actually seems like it could have been slotted easily into *Fantasia*.
* *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed* is one of the highlights of the film. Good music, good story. Part of the appeal for me might be nostalgia, as we had this short taped off *The Wonderful World of Disney* when I was a kid.
* *Little Toot*, about an anthropomorphic tugboat who can't seem to stay out of trouble, isn't very strong. It's fine, I guess. *Trees* is a short segment based on the poem ""Trees"" by Joyce Kilmer. The visuals are quite nice, and have a real *Fantasia* feel to them. *Blame It on the Samba*, starring Donald Duck and Jose Carioca, is insubstantial, but good for a chuckle.
* Finally we have *Pecos Bill*, the longest segment at twenty-two minutes. Like *The Legend of Johnny Appleseed*, it's a colorful and entertaining ""tall tale"", narrated by none other than Roy Rogers. It portrays Pecos as basically a god of Texan mythology, responsible for such feats as carving the Rio Grande and painting the Painted Desert.

**In Conclusion**

As noted above, *Melody Time* is probably the best in its family of features. Though it's still just a mediocrity in the Disney canon, I'd rank it above *Make Mine Music*, *Fun and Fancy Free*, *The Three Caballeros*, and *Saludos Amigos*.

Binge Watching Content Being Removed,"I subscribed to Disney Plus right before it launched and originally had the three year deal. I've always really enjoyed the service and still do but definitely disappointed by the removal of shows, but understand the move from a business perspective. 

I've had a busy year and spent more of my free time on games and getting of the house. I didn't have time to watch some series and movies I wanted to get around to, with some free time this weekend and working from home I'm trying to marathon and binge watch a lot of the content I missed and was wondering if anyone else was before they remove it? 

Like I just watched all of Willow and I actually really enjoyed it. The second half kind of really removes itself from the original movie, but I don't think anywhere bad as it was made out to be. It was fun, silly, campy, and ridiculous. Loved the CGI and practical effects and it's too bad it'll be left on a cliffhanger. I didn't watch the original movie until I was an adult so there wasn't nostalgia there so I can see why people would feel like it abandoned what they love, but as a story se in the same universe I thought it was great especially Warwick Davis. 

Now in the middle of season 2 of The Mysterious Benedict Society. Absolutely adored the first season and how much detail went into it. I just love how quirky the whole thing is. I love the the color palette, the way it is filmed almost has a Wes Anderson or Pushing Daisies vibe to it, Tony Hale and Kristen Schaal are amazing and all of the kids are really great. I think losing this one is definitely a big loss and hope it finds a home or becomes a bit of a cult classic.

Plan is to get through Big Shot Season 2, Mighty Ducks Season 2, and the Quest and hoping to catch some of the movies and short documentaries like M Power or Voices Rising before they all go off. Probably won't have the time to finish everything but it's fun rediscovering a lot of these originals before they are gone, reminds me of that first month of the service back in 2019.",43,0.86,32,lampfiles,:Discussion: Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1684676769.0,False,False,False,2023-05-21 13:46:09,i subscribed to disney plus right before it launched and originally had the three year deal ive always really enjoyed the service and still do but definitely disappointed by the removal of shows but understand the move from a business perspective ive had a busy year and spent more of my free time on games and getting of the house i didnt have time to watch some series and movies i wanted to get around to with some free time this weekend and working from home im trying to marathon and binge watch a lot of the content i missed and was wondering if anyone else was before they remove it like i just watched all of willow and i actually really enjoyed it the second half kind of really removes itself from the original movie but i dont think anywhere bad as it was made out to be it was fun silly campy and ridiculous loved the cgi and practical effects and its too bad itll be left on a cliffhanger i didnt watch the original movie until i was an adult so there wasnt nostalgia there so i can see why people would feel like it abandoned what they love but as a story se in the same universe i thought it was great especially warwick davis now in the middle of season of the mysterious benedict society absolutely adored the first season and how much detail went into it i just love how quirky the whole thing is i love the the color palette the way it is filmed almost has a wes anderson or pushing daisies vibe to it tony hale and kristen schaal are amazing and all of the kids are really great i think losing this one is definitely a big loss and hope it finds a home or becomes a bit of a cult classic plan is to get through big shot season mighty ducks season and the quest and hoping to catch some of the movies and short documentaries like m power or voices rising before they all go off probably wont have the time to finish everything but its fun rediscovering a lot of these originals before they are gone reminds me of that first month of the service back in,binge watching content being removed,1

 **Overview**

One of several anthology features Disney produced during the 1940s in order to offset the troubles presented by World War II, *Make Mine Music* is a loose collection of short animated features set to various types of music, with performances by Doris Day, Benny Goodman, the Andrews Sisters, and other popular artists of the day. It was never reissued in theaters after its initial release, nor did it receive a proper home video release until 2000, but its many segments saw exposure to Disney fans over the decades, paired up with longer features or broadcast on TV.

**Point by Point**

* Honestly, there isn't much to say about this one. Each segment is very run-of-the-mill, without any particular innovation or prestige. *The Martins and the Coys* (inspired by the real-life feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys) is amusing enough as an opening number, but largely insipid. *All the Cats Join In* \- a sequence depicting hip teens dancing to swing music at the malt shoppe - is okay too. *Casey at the Bat* is probably the most compelling of them all, but still nothing special.
* *Peter and the Wolf*, *Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet*, and *The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met* are each pretty tedious. Others, such as *Blue Bayou* and *Two Silhouettes*, are so insubstantial as to not be worth mentioning.

**In Conclusion**

After enduring *Saludos Amigos* and *The Three Caballeros* before this, I'm really getting tired of these decidedly mediocre anthologies that did nothing to stretch Disney's creative muscle. Unfortunately, circumstances were what they were; their budget was tight, the foreign markets were closed off, and their people were fighting in the War. It is true that projects such as these helped Disney save up money for later triumphs such as *Cinderella*, *Peter Pan*, and *Alice in Wonderland*, so I suppose there's that.

 **Overview**

A companion to *Saludos Amigos*, *The Three Caballeros* continues Disney's endorsement of Latin American culture, and also celebrates Donald Duck's tenth anniversary (he debuted in 1934). The narrative framing device sees Donald receiving presents from and celebrating with his Latin American friends, Jose Carioca (returning from *Saludos Amigos*) and Panchito Pistoles (a new character).

**Point by Point**

* We open with a short cartoon about a penguin (oddly enough) named Pablo, who dislikes the cold and wishes to trade the South Pole for South America. This is followed by a fact-based animated segment about various birds native to South America, which is a bit dry.
* After a cartoon about a flying donkey from Uruguay, Jose shows up and takes Donald on a tour of the Brazilian state of Bahia. The song 'Have You Been to Bahia?' is a pretty one. The segment blends animation with live-action, and we see Donald and Jose interacting with human performers. I'd say the sequence runs a little long, however.
* Donald opens his gift from Mexico and Panchito pops out, pistols firing. This is where the title song 'The Three Caballeros' is performed. It's a lively, catchy number, and is undoubtedly the highlight of the film.
* Next we learn about Mexico, and the boys take another live-action tour, hitting key locations like Mexico City and Acapulco. Like the one in Bahia, this sequence is kind of interminable. There's *a lot* of Donald becoming infatuated with live-action women and chasing after them, and the whole thing eventually collapses into some sort of fever dream. It abruptly ends with Donald and friends reenacting a bullfight, and some fireworks.

**In Conclusion**

*The Three Caballeros* is superior to *Saludos Amigos* due to its increased substance, but, like that other film, it has nothing to really recommend itself. Its only real value is as a curio, and, unless you're a WDAS completist, you can safely skip over this one.

I''ve seen every Muppet movie, every episode of ""The Muppet Show"" and everything they've released on Disney+ lately... I even cried in the cinema during ""The Muppets"" when they lost the theatre by $1... then 1 cent thanks to Fozzie

Muppets Mayhem brings to light the mayhem that is... The Electric Mayhem. 

I love Animal and I love Janice ""fer sher"" but I didn't know much about Floyd, Lips and Zoot but I love the whole band after this show

Lips is probably one of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I have NO clue what he says half the time but he's so funny! 

The humans on the show are somewhat okay, I love Nora and Moog and all the celeb cameos. Didn't care for her sister and the blonde guy (can tell cause I don't know their names 🤣) 

The songs mostly slap, and it's just a good time all around. Even teared up at their final song (no spoilers dw)

So basically I want a season 2! 
This is my plea that if you have 30 mins to watch the first episode and keep going (the 8th one was kinda cringe but the last 2 eps make up for it)

"Your thoughts on ""Saludos Amigos"" (1943)","&#x200B;

 **Overview**

After *Bambi*, and largely because of World War II, Disney's next several animated features were anthologies, rather than single, longer narratives. The first of these was *Saludos Amigos*, commissioned by the U.S. Department of State as part of Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy with regards to Latin America. At just forty-two minutes long, it is by far the shortest feature in the WDAS canon.

**Point by Point**

* *Saludos Amigos* (which is Spanish for ""Greetings, Friends"") is a collection of four short cartoons, framed by brief, intermittent, live-action blurbs of unnamed Disney artists exploring Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru, and taking in the local color. The first cartoon features Donald Duck exploring the Lake Titicaca area, to predictably slapstick results.
* Next up is a cartoon called *Pedro*, about an anthropomorphic little mail plane who is tasked with flying over the mighty Andes to deliver the mail from Argentina to Chile. He runs into a violent storm high above the mountain range, but he pulls through all right.
* We're served a bit of education on Buenos Aires and the fertile Argentinian plains called the Pampas. Then our third cartoon, *El Gaucho Goofy*, sees Texan cowboy Goofy transplanted to Argentina to learn about the similar lifestyle of a *gaucho* (basically the Latin American cowboy).
* *Aquarela do Brasil* (""Watercolor of Brazil"") is the fourth and final cartoon, with an unseen artist painting alluring scenery onscreen (kind of like that famous *Looney Tunes* short where Elmer Fudd uses a paintbrush to mess with Bugs Bunny), to the tune of Ary Barroso's 'Aquarela do Brasil'. Written in 1939, the song became internationally famous after being featured in *Saludos Amigos*. Also featured in this short is new character Jose Carioca (later of *The Three Caballeros*) teaching Donald Duck about the samba.

**In Conclusion**

*Saludos Amigos* is pleasant enough, but it has nothing exceptional to recommend it. It's simply nothing more than four standard cartoons, framed by a little bit of very broad, very basic trivia on Latin American culture. There's really no reason to watch it at all unless you're a WDAS completist. I guess audiences were happy with it back then, but, after what we've seen so far, it's disappointingly mediocre.

Is Disneyplus removing its Originals to other streaming services?,"https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/lifestyle/disney-remove-streaming-content-follows-181340112.html

https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/disney-will-start-removing-content-streaming-platforms-1234861274/

I really hope Disney doesn’t license out their big titles from Marvel and Star Wars, especially their Original shows. It’s one of the things that I like about D+ and distinguishes it from the other services, where I can binge all the: Iron Man movies, Thor, Captain America, etc. in timeline order, release order, or whatever Marvel show or movie I feel like watching, well you get the gist. I like and appreciate that I can watch all of them without having to search up where to watch the next movie/show in the timeline and pay again to watch that. 

I feel like Disney losing 4 Million subs gave them a big scare and now instead of creating more original content, they’re doing the opposite, which might very well lose them even more subscribers if the lack of content and price hikes aren’t already.

RANT: Almost a year later - still no localization options available for Bulgaria/Croatia/Serbia/Slovenia!!!!,"We're closing in on a FULL YEAR (that would be June 14th) since the service launched in the countries mentioned above (among many others) and there is still ZERO titles with subtitles or dubs available in Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian.

I was visiting my folks in Bulgaria recently and was curious how far the service had come in those regions since launch. The library is great, among the best in the entire world, but the lack of proper localization means that I still cannot share this wonderful service with my parents, and trust me - they love Disney and they also love their procedurals like Criminal Minds.

Now, mind you, the local Disney Channel has been fully localized for more than 14 years with dubs available for every single TV show/film/programme that has ever been broadcast on it. On the other hand, 14 years later, the local Disney Channel is still broadcast in SD at a mere 576i....

The theatrical animated films from Walt Disney Studios, Pixar and 20th Century Studios have (for more than 2 decades) always been fully dubbed/subbed and those dubs/subs are, strangely, available for rent or to buy on Apple TV. Huh?

So, all in all, a lot of the content is already there. Yes, some technical hurdles would have to be overcome and the company would have to pay to someone to clean some of the files up, but it all comes with the territory.

This sort of negligence towards the people in those countries is absolutely inexcusable and shows that the company truly doesn't care.

Last but not least - it's not about the size or the population of the countries. There's plenty of countries smaller in size and/or population than the ones I mentioned above, some even in he same region, that have had subs and dubs delivered to them in a timely manner. The truth is that someone along the line, who is responsible for the development of the service in the region, dropped the ball and there's no one to pick it up.

Trust me, plenty of people are willing to subscribe (and many younger people already have). My parents, for example, have subs to both HBO Max and SkyShowtime, because those platforms chose not to exclude them from their potential subscriber base.

"Your thoughts on ""Dumbo"" (1941)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l2lsvxn2ruya1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a17c9c481840bf263686f7c71041cf23db6488af

 **Overview**

Deliberately simpler and lower budget than *Pinocchio* and *Fantasia*, in order to recoup the financial losses of those two prior films, *Dumbo* is one of Disney's shortest animated features, but also one of its most charming. It's the first to focus primarily on animal characters, and the charm and whimsy with which it does so bodes well for the many, many such features in Disney's future.

**Point by Point**

* The opening credits on what appear to be colorful, circus-themed postcards, set against bombastic, celebratory music, set the tone right away, getting the viewer keyed up for something exciting. It's a bit different than 'When You Wish Upon a Star'.
* The sequence with the storks delivering the cute baby animals to their mothers at the circus is a good way to start off. It made me smile.
* Mrs. Jumbo's love for Dumbo is immediate and unconditional. She isn't bothered by his big ears at all. While the other elephants are voicing their alarm, she doesn't bat an eye. In fact, she uses his ears to swaddle him.
* Another good sequence comes as the circus laborers and the elephants cooperate to hoist the big top against a driving thunderstorm. (Yes, the laborers are all black men who sing a song about being illiterate and irresponsible with money. It is what it is. I'm blowing past it.)
* Dumbo being given a bath and playing with his mother is a cute and joyful sequence; possibly the best moment in the movie. Of course, it all comes to an end when the two are forcibly separated, after Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper defending Dumbo from an abusive child. The circus workers are lucky that none of them are killed, frankly. Mrs. Jumbo is huge, and strong, and her eyes go red with fury as she flings her little antagonists through the air. In that moment she would have trampled them all to get to Dumbo and would have thought nothing of it.
* The other elephants are awful, still running Dumbo down while he's sitting alone and crying after being taken from his mother. And when he goes to them for help, they turn their backs on him. He's a baby, you bitches! What's wrong with you?
* Timothy Mouse is a good proxy for the viewer, earnest and supportive, in the same vein as Jiminy Cricket in *Pinocchio*, and especially useful because Dumbo doesn't speak.
* The elephant pyramid sequence is impressive and suspenseful, with a real sense of weight to it. You can feel the sense of precariousness through the screen, and the catastrophic payoff is priceless.
* So, poor Dumbo is a clown now. Everyone talks about the racial stereotypes, but this is another thing that wouldn't play well with modern audiences; nobody wants to see a baby elephant bullied and abused like the clowns do here.
* The 'Baby Mine' sequence, where Dumbo visits his incarcerated mother, is a sweet one. It could be a lot sadder, given its context, but Dumbo and his mother are just so happy to see each other, and their reunion is marked mostly by smiles, not tears.
* This is soon followed, of course, by 'Pink Elephants on Parade', possibly a highlight of the film. The sequence is striking, frenetic, and even a little spooky.
* The crows may be racial stereotypes, but they're great characters all the same. They're snappy and funny, and even when they're making fun of Dumbo, they don't come off as especially mean. The song 'When I See an Elephant Fly' is a delight, and has become the film's signature.
* The moment when Dumbo takes flight at the circus (and takes his playful revenge on his tormentors) is genuinely triumphant. And we're relieved, too, to know that Dumbo will be treated better from now on.

**In Conclusion**

*Dumbo* is a simple movie. It's short and sweet, and it isn't as great a work of art as its predecessors in the WDAS canon. Nevertheless, it's a fun, charming, and joyful romp from start to finish, and perfectly encapsulates the Disney method of storytelling, despite its lower budget and abbreviated running time. A classic for a reason, it overcomes its shortcomings (and its problematic caricatures) with style and flair.

Recommendations for Christmas-themed Shows/Movies," 

Dear DisneyPlus Reddit community,

I hope this message finds you all doing well. As strange as it may seem, my kids and I love to watch Christmas-themed TV shows and movies all year round. Even though it's the month of May, we still find comfort in watching animated series with lots of Christmas episodes or any content that exudes the holiday spirit.

However, I find myself in a difficult situation lately. My mother passed away (she was living us for the past couple of years), and I am now raising two kids on my own. It's been a struggle, and I feel that watching these kinds of shows could help us feel a little bit better and bring some much-needed joy to our lives.

I'm reaching out to this community because I'm hoping to get some recommendations on the best shows or movies available on DisneyPlus that have a lot of Christmas episodes or themes.

"Your Thoughts on ""Pinocchio"" (1940)","&#x200B;

 Based on the best-selling children's novel *The Adventures of Pinocchio* by Italian author Carlo Collodi, Disney's follow-up to their smash hit *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* came along a full three years later, and at just the wrong time. World War II cut off access to European and Asian markets, and *Pinocchio*, through no fault of its own, was a box office failure upon its initial release. The film wouldn't make a profit until its re-release in 1945. Despite this, it's become legendary over the decades, and is widely regarded as one of the best films in the Disney canon.

**Point by Point**

* We open with Jiminy Cricket singing 'When You Wish Upon a Star' over the title sequence. It's a nice song, it won an Academy Award the following year, and it's become the de facto anthem for the Disney company itself. It seems old-hat these days when you hear it played over the castle logo at the start of every film, but, in this context, it's easy to understand its appeal.
* As nice as *Snow White* looks, the visuals of *Pinocchio* far surpass it. Everything is so bright and colorful and vibrant, the animation is buttery smooth, and the music and sound effects integrate themselves flawlessly. Groundbreaking effects animation (rain, lightning, smoke, shadows, etc.) make the world seem alive. From here you can definitely glimpse what spectacle Disney will go on to achieve in the future.
* Geppetto is a funny, likable character, and his absentmindedness and frequent befuddlement are rich sources of comedy. His pets Figaro and Cleo are cute. Pinocchio, too, is much more likable and endearing here. In the source novel, Pinocchio is kind of a dick; spiteful, selfish, lazy, and always needing to learn his lessons the hard way. When the film's Pinocchio gets led astray, it's due more to an innocence and naivety befitting one who has just been born.
* The con men Honest John and Gideon whom Pinocchio encounters on his way to school aren't presented as villains so much as a malevolent force of nature. They're so overbearing and irresistible, it's as though they represent all the evils of the world crashing over the fresh-faced, inexperienced Pinocchio like a pounding wave. You get the sense that Pinocchio's encounter with them, and all that they represent, is inevitable. If he had taken a completely different path to school, he still would have met them in some shape or form.
* You don't notice it watching the movie as a child, but Jiminy Cricket is utterly useless. His job is to be Pinocchio's ""conscience"", and to guide him on the straight and narrow, but, after Pinocchio is drafted into Stromboli's puppet theater, Jiminy walks out on him! And he does the same thing again on Pleasure Island, after Pinocchio falls in with Lampwick. And where is Jiminy while Pinocchio and Geppetto are trapped inside of Monstro? He's outside, floating in a bottle. Jiminy Cricket has become one of Disney's most memorable and iconic characters, but he doesn't actually *do* anything.
* 'I've Got No Strings' is a fun and lively number, with Pinocchio accompanied by international flavors of marionettes. It might just be the first real toe-tapper in the WDAS songbook.
* The nose-growing sequence, where Pinocchio is confronted by the Blue Fairy about his misbehavior, is a perfect example of Disney's penchant for taking something fanciful and making it even more so. In the book, Pinocchio's nose grows when he lies. In the movie, his nose not only grows, it sprouts leaves; and flowers; and even a nest, complete with birds and eggs! Disney takes every whimsical thing from the story they're adapting and adds even more color and fancy.
* The fate of the boys on Pleasure Island seems pretty harsh. So they wanted to play and have a good time instead of going to school. Can you blame them? And for all that, they end up transformed into unspeaking beasts of burden bound for the salt mines. But that's old timey morality tales for you. Disobey your parents and your life is irrevocably ruined.
* The underwater landscapes, while Pinocchio treads the ocean floor on his search for Geppetto, are really striking and beautiful, and the wavy water effects are, for lack of a better term, highly immersive. Up until that point in animation history, it was probably the best that a sub-aquatic environment had ever looked.
* It's clear that Pinocchio has grown immensely by this point in the story. When he hears that Geppetto is *inside of a whale*, he takes off for the ocean without a second thought. And when he finally reunites with Geppetto inside the belly of said whale, he devises a clever escape plan almost immediately. He has indeed become brave, truthful, and unselfish, just as the Blue Fairy directed him.
* I won't lie; as a little kid, I was scared of Monstro. His size, his bellows, his angry yellow eyes, his gaping maw full of teeth. An immense, unstoppable force of nature. The dread of Pinocchio and Geppetto all by themselves on a tiny raft in the middle of the open ocean, fragile and vulnerable as a hateful beast the size of a football field bears down on them. A suspenseful, nail-biting climax to the adventure.
* And, of course, the joyous final scene, when Pinocchio is revived from death as a real boy. It's not just his reward, but ours too, for sharing the journey with him.

**In Conclusion**

It's hard to believe that *Pinocchio* was only Disney's second animated feature film. It's such a masterful example of the art form, you'd think they'd been at it for much longer. It's a fun and lively adventure, beautifully crafted, full of humor and heart, populated by many larger-than-life characters. The fact that Disney's next project following this one was *Fantasia* speaks volumes about the confidence the studio had rightly earned.

The hidden message of Pleasure Island in both the 1940 and 2022 Pinocchio movies,"In both the 1940 and 2022 Pinocchio movies, there are places on Pleasure Island **made specifically** for doing things which would be considered misbehaving such as roughhousing, vandalizing a building, destroying things, but what appears to justify the kids being turned into donkeys in the original movie is the fact that they smoke and drink alcohol. However, in the 2022 movie there is no smoking -- out of respect to Walt Disney who died at the relatively young age of 65 because he was a heavy smoker -- and the kids do not knowingly drink alcohol, so a number of people have stated that the kids are being punished for having fun and are not misbehaving because this place was made specifically for shoplifting, vandalism, etc., etc. Personally, I feel if you showed either movie to a kid, they would understand that shoplifting, vandalism, theft, insulting each other, roughhousing, playing with fireworks and firecrackers is wrong.

I feel that Pleasure Island has another message in both movies. The message is NOT that eating candy, drinking root beer, going on amusement park rides and doing fun things which are part of the game is bad, it's that kids need to be aware that things which are too good to be true are a scam/probably false and if they're gullible enough will believe to be real. If they're not careful bad things can happen -- not turned into a donkey and be sold for a profit or anything like that, but still bad things can happen or it's not what they thought it was.

The kids probably only learned about Pleasure Island either from flyers or from a COMPLETE STRANGER that they likely met for the first time that night, not from anybody they know who has actually been there and experienced it. If Pleasure Island is such a wonderful place for kids to go to and so close to home then why haven’t these kids heard of it before? Parents would see an exotic Disneyland or Disneyworld like place (essentially in their own backyard which they probably never heard of before) with no rules or adults where kids can have all the candy and root beer they want, and has places where shoplifting, stealing things from each other, vandalizing schools, breaking clocks, insulting each other, sword fight with firecrackers, and shoot fireworks at each other is legal and can do it at will without any consequences is very fishy, but the kids won't think this is fishy and if they don't suspect anything fishy bad things can happen to them.

Don't talk to, go anywhere with a stranger, or take anything from a stranger.

Even in the 1940 movie, Jiminy Cricket finds the place to be phony and wants to get Pinocchio off the island. The saying ""stupid little boys"" doesn't necessarily mean they're naughty little boys, but they're Very Gullible. In real life there have been children or people in their late teens-early 20s which have been lured to someone or into their house for reasons which are not wrong, and they are duped and killed or held captive.

Why Iger Needs A New Approach To Marvel Output,"Disney CEO Bob Iger didn’t mince words Thursday at Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media & Telecom Conference when it came to addressing former CEO Bob Chapek’s reorganization in 2020. 

Iger highlighted what he viewed as a “disconnect” while discussing Disney’s streaming business, saying that while the service grew due to “the strength of the content,” there needs to be a stronger link between “what’s being spent and what’s being earned … from a revenue perspective.” 

Marvel and Lucasfilm deserve a lot of credit for the success of Disney+, but the cost of content for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and “Star Wars” has been a big contributor to Disney’s direct-to-consumer losses. Examine the track records of these two brands, and there’s a clear difference Iger needs to appreciate. 

#Disney's Billion-Dollar MCU & 'Star Wars' Films 

Since the release of the first “Avengers” film in 2012, which earned $1.5 billion globally, seven additional MCU films distributed by Disney were billion-dollar grossers, with 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” the No. 2 worldwide grosser in history.

“Endgame” was also the last MCU film from Disney to surpass $1 billion. Since the pandemic, the only MCU film to become a billion-dollar grosser was Sony’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” which took in nearly $2 billion, a big jump from the $1.1 billion 2019’s “Spider-Man: Far From Home” grossed after “Endgame.”

Only four of Disney’s “Star Wars” films hit that mark. But that’s out of five total, as opposed to the 23 MCU films Disney has released.

Even with mixed reviews, 2019’s “The Rise of Skywalker” still brought in almost $1.1 billion, slightly more than “Rogue One,” one of two standalone films separate from the new trilogy, did in 2016.

“Solo,” the other lone film, made less than $400 million globally in 2018.

“Maybe the cadence was a little too aggressive,” said Iger on “Solo” while discussing the care Disney needs to exercise in its content spend.

Still, “Star Wars” transitioned mediums successfully after “The Rise of Skywalker,” with four series having since debuted on Disney+. Flagship series “The Mandalorian” and “Rogue One” prequel series “Andor” are the standouts out of four live-action series in total that have streamed, the former having just premiered its third season. Unlike “The Book of Boba Fett” and “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” “Andor” has another season in the works.

By contrast, Disney+ has seen seven live-action MCU series debut since 2021, with the eighth, “Secret Invasion,” due in 2023. Only one series, “Loki,” has a second season on the way. Just as many MCU films have played in theaters during this period, as opposed to zero “Star Wars” films.

Given that a core function of the MCU’s highest-grossing films is sticking a ton of different heroes together at once, to the delight of fans, Iger is right to be critical of the number of shows devoted to Marvel characters, nearly all of them supporting cast for the bigger heroes in the films.

As Iger put it Thursday, he is scrutinizing “how often we go back to the well with certain characters” and how many sequels each franchise truly needs.

Now that “Avatar” is back, with the first of four new sequels having done far better at the global box office than Disney’s best MCU film post-pandemic, it’s high time for Disney to figure out a more practical and monetizable model for Marvel.",4,0.6,6,HumanOrAlien,:News: News Article,0,False,False,link,variety.com,1682436077.0,False,False,False,2023-04-25 15:21:17,disney ceo bob iger didnt mince words thursday at morgan stanleys technology media telecom conference when it came to addressing former ceo bob chapeks reorganization in iger highlighted what he viewed as a disconnect while discussing disneys streaming business saying that while the service grew due to the strength of the content there needs to be a stronger link between whats being spent and whats being earned from a revenue perspective marvel and lucasfilm deserve a lot of credit for the success of disney but the cost of content for the marvel cinematic universe and star wars has been a big contributor to disneys directtoconsumer losses examine the track records of these two brands and theres a clear difference iger needs to appreciate disneys billiondollar mcu star wars films since the release of the first avengers film in which earned billion globally seven additional mcu films distributed by disney were billiondollar grossers with s avengers endgame the no worldwide grosser in history endgame was also the last mcu film from disney to surpass billion since the pandemic the only mcu film to become a billiondollar grosser was sonys spiderman no way home which took in nearly billion a big jump from the billion s spiderman far from home grossed after endgame only four of disneys star wars films hit that mark but thats out of five total as opposed to the mcu films disney has released even with mixed reviews s the rise of skywalker still brought in almost billion slightly more than rogue one one of two standalone films separate from the new trilogy did in solo the other lone film made less than million globally in maybe the cadence was a little too aggressive said iger on solo while discussing the care disney needs to exercise in its content spend still star wars transitioned mediums successfully after the rise of skywalker with four series having since debuted on disney flagship series the mandalorian and rogue one prequel series andor are the standouts out of four liveaction series in total that have streamed the former having just premiered its third season unlike the book of boba fett and obiwan kenobi andor has another season in the works by contrast disney has seen seven liveaction mcu series debut since with the eighth secret invasion due in only one series loki has a second season on the way just as many mcu films have played in theaters during this period as opposed to zero star wars films given that a core function of the mcus highestgrossing films is sticking a ton of different heroes together at once to the delight of fans iger is right to be critical of the number of shows devoted to marvel characters nearly all of them supporting cast for the bigger heroes in the films as iger put it thursday he is scrutinizing how often we go back to the well with certain characters and how many sequels each franchise truly needs now that avatar is back with the first of four new sequels having done far better at the global box office than disneys best mcu film postpandemic its high time for disney to figure out a more practical and monetizable model for marvel,why iger needs a new approach to marvel output,1

Disney+ layout is just horrible.,"While I find Disney+ to look aesthetic, and modern, the way they layout their content is so awful.

I think Disney+ is the only app, where when you navigate through the catalog, you will scroll past the same movie/show multiple times.

For example, the Marvel section of Disney+ has 28 rows. Some of those rows are just the actual show, but with each episode laid out to occupy an entire row, instead of being it’s own box. In addition to being its own box multiple times throughout different rows.

There are many other examples of this, but the way Disney+ organizes their content is bafflingly moronic.

Why did Disney retcon the amazing season 2 finale of The Mandalorian?,"The Mandalorian has been the main thing I've seriously enjoyed from Disney lately (and also Rogue One in terms of Star Wars). But not just the season two finale (which was completely fing fantastic and I've watched it many times) was erased, the whole overarching story plot up to that point was rendered meaningless; when finally the long term goal of getting baby Yoda the Jedi training he needed to protect himself, the next season it was all retconned.

I enjoyed the episode 7 very much, I'm hyped for the new storyline, but I'm still quite dissepointed, and don't see how it couldn't have happened without retconning away literally one of the highest rated show plot culininations ever (S2E8 - 9.8 on IMDB).

I'd say the first two sessions of The Mandalorian is some of the best Star Wars have had to offer, I'm sad that I will never see a continuation of the original plot, and that I got to ignore the retconning to pretend like the original plot mattered I guess.

How could Disney make this decision?

"Your thoughts on ""Strange World"" (2022)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b54u98yoq6nb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec81ccf094af3c4392ca0deab879b2b6ae88a1a2

**Overview**

*Strange World* is an adventure story that draws inspiration from old sci fi stories in pulp magazines, and movies like *Journey to the Center of the Earth* and *Fantastic Voyage*. It was a huge bomb at the box office (performing worse than Pixar's *Lightyear*), but I don't think Disney ever believed in it or cared about it, and their almost nonexistent advertising for the film bears that out. Affected by a number of factors (such as the public willingness to wait for animated movies to stream on Disney+, and the controversial presence of the studio's first openly LGBT character), Disney seemingly sent *Strange World* out to die and put all their focus into bigger contemporary films like *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* and *Avatar: The Way of Water*.

**Point by Point**

* *Strange World* opens with celebrated explorer Jaeger Clade and his tag-along son Searcher attempting to breach the mountains that surround their insular country of Avalonia, as no one has ever ventured past them. After a good-looking set piece in a collapsing ice cave, Searcher discovers a plant growing nearby that generates electricity (which Avalonia has not yet discovered and harnessed). Searcher wants to take the plant back to the people of Avalonia, but Jaeger stubbornly insists on continuing the expedition past the mountains, so the two end up going their separate ways.
* Twenty-five years later, Searcher and his family (wife Meridian and son Ethan) are farmers, providing Avalonia with crops of the electric plant (now called Pando) it needs in order to power society. Just as Searcher rejected his father's expectations for him years ago, however, his own son Ethan isn't so sure he wants to inherit the farm. The town is pretty and well lit, and the overall aesthetic really puts me in mind of Columbia in *Bioshock Infinite*.
* For reasons unknown, Pando crops all over are dying, so Searcher joins an expedition to find out why, and what can be done to save it. Pando is actually a singular organism deep underground, putting out tendrils all over the surface, and the expedition intends to travel to the “heart of Pando”. Predictably, Searcher's adventurous son stows away, and Mom follows both of them. There's also a three-legged dog named Legend who ends up getting into all sorts of endearing mischief.
* The world beneath the surface looks really good, and is populated with weird flora and fauna. Before long they discover Jaeger, who's been trapped down here all this time. This provides some opportunities for family drama and heart-to-heart chats, none of which is very interesting. There are some good action set pieces, however, including fights with the local creatures and a voyage across an acidic sea.
* Ultimately, the characters find out that their world is actually an immense, turtle-like creature, and that they've been traveling through its insides this whole time! Not only that, Pando is an infection that's killing the creature and must be destroyed! (A bit on the nose, I think. Avalonia's source of power is killing their world and they have to give it up? Okay, Disney, you first, but good luck running your amusement parks on just wind and solar.)

**In Conclusion**

*Strange World* is strikingly reminiscent of *Atlantis: The Lost Empire*. It's a low-key adventure story with gradual pacing, character development, and slightly more grown-up themes. I can't see young children being very captivated by it. Like *Atlantis*, I think it will be re-evaluated in due time. For now, I rank it Okay.

"Confused on my bundle, about the planned price increase, and the options to change bundles.","**SOLVED:**

Sorry for the lengthy post but I'm scratching my head on this.

&#x200B;

I signed up for the Disney+ bundle when it first started. Wanting Hulu no ads, I upgraded my Hulu plan to the ad-free plan. Never touched my accounts since then...

When I look at my Disney+ account, it shows I have the ""Legacy Disney Bundle"" for $15/month.

So right now, I'm getting charged $15/month when I check my Hulu account and $7/month when I check my Disney+ account. So total $22/month. So yeah I've been paying $2/month total more now than the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

Got the email from saying  ""The price of Disney Bundle Trio Basic will increase on October 12, 2023 to $14.99/month. The price change will be reflected in your first billing cycle on or after October 12."" But I don't have that bundle.

...

When the increase happens, my Hulu plan will increase to $18/month (says when I check on my account page)...not sure what my Disney+ will charge me. If it's still $7/month, I'm fine with that since that equals the ""Disney Bundle Trio Premium"" bundle.

But if Disney+ will charge more then I want to change my bundle. BUT...i don't see any. Disney+ only shows option for Disney+ (basic for premium) and Hulu only shows option for Hulu (Hulu or Hulu (no-ads)).

* Magic Nose Tap - Where has this come from?
* CGI Reindeer - Do I need to say anything else?

Disney+ user interface sucks!,"So as a subscriber and paying money for this service, I am expecting a usable interface to deal with. Not with Disney+.

When I log on I am presented with their main page, where I can choose between Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic and Star.

This selection by itself is inconsistent. Star Wars will show you only everything about star wars, a movie franchise, while Disney will show the disney portfolio, and Star will show any ""not made for kids"" stuff.

When choosing Star, I get a new menu showing the star content, but if I select a show, there is no back-button, and I have to go all the way back to the startpage, select star, and then the show I want to watch. Is this really by design?!

And also, as another dude here mentioned... max 720p is fooling people and not giving what is promised. When, on PC going to appsettings, it shows ""stream in highest available quality up to 4k (4,2GB/h) as the chosen setting.

Edit: Another thing that is bothering me, is that Disney+ doesnt remember consistently what I have watched. Several episodes watched is listed as If I haven't seen them. It makes it impossible to start up where I left. Some episodes DO get registered, but most doesn't.

"Great Service, Just Not Enough To Keep Every Month","I'm not knocking Disney Plus. I just don't think it's worth paying $7.99 per month plus tax if I'm interested in only one series.

So I'm watching 'The Mandalorian' for the first time....,"Firstly, the Starwars original story is based on a story by a Japanese director named Akira Kurosawa who was extremely influential to many of the great directors in the 20th century. The film The Hidden Fortress is a story told from the perspective of two peasants, who help a Princess.

That said, the Mandalorian has a chapter that is basically the same plot as another Akira Kuwosawa Film called 'Seven Samurai' about a town of peasants who hire some mercenaries to help protect their village.

Disney+ won't be as nostalgic for today's kids as Disney Channel was for us,"Hear me out, I'm curious to see what you all think.

Many of us grew up fond of the Disney Channel. The adverts that would have the ""you're watching Disney Channel"" segments. The countdown in the corner until High School Musical 2 or other big events. The halloween specials like Wizards Vs Vampires on Waverly Place. Disney+ has nothing to replace this nostalgia factor.

When you would get excited to the new shows coming out with one scheduled per week, instead of being spoiled and having everything available at once on Disney+. Coming home from school to see the new Hannah Montana or That's So Raven episodes... those were the days 

There's also the massive improvement in show quality which actually removed some of the charm. Take High School Musical The Musical The Series for example, which is filmed almost like a top budget drama. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but it lacks the charm of the cheesy shows we grew up with. It just doesn't seem like it'll hit the same for kids of today.

It's interesting because I watched Nickelodeon as much as I did Disney as a kid but the latter is far more nostalgic as they definitely knew how to advertise and market their content. That no longer seems to be the case.

I live in The Netherlands and I have had a terrible experience with the Disney+ app so far. Here is my experience.,"First off. Content... It's terribly small for Disney who basically owns the film industry. Nothing from 20th century Fox and apart from some Disney classics, a few Live action, Star Wars and Marvel not much more to see. The list with all other movies is a couple of Home Alone's and mostly some really bad low quality Christmas movies. The meme about the so called ""VAULT"" is still alive. Disney has not yet released the lock with all this juicy content.

No to get to the point. The app and streaming service itself.

\- No support for Android TV's with remotes. If you have a remote with arrow keys like me on a Android media box. Press that arrow key once and you are gonna have a bad time. Instant crash. Even after 3 updates.

\- No continue playback from where you left! If you log in next time and want to finish a movie good luck finding back where you left off. Perhaps you watched a couple of shows. There's no History at all!

\- No history!

\- Buffering takes long! Not only is there no feedback in the forever spinning circle of buffering(Netflix has a percentage number in the middle so you know it's doing something) It always tries to playback something in the highest quality from the start without adjusting it automatically based on connection. For example, Netflix starts streaming right away and you may be in 420P during the first logo but by the time it reaches the start of the movie it up scales the resolution quickly which result in faster loading times and quicker reflexes based on network speeds. Disney+ seems not to do any of that and simply goes for the long loading time and default quality. Which don't get me wrong is good but annoying it takes so long! (I have Fiber internet of the highest speed in Amsterdam BTW) Our country is known for one of the fastest speed in the world.

\- NO RETURN BUTTON ON THE WEBBROWSER! So do you all know that situation when you are scrolling to a long library of movies and see something you might like click on it for more detail but decide... nevermind. On Netflix and any streaming platform you simply press the arrow back and continue scrolling trough the library from where you left off. On Disney+ There simply is NO ARROW BACK or BACK button on the browser. So how do you go back? Either you press back on your browser which refreshes the last page which is the home screen of Disney+ or you click one of the tabs for film or series on the top which also refreshes your Library from the top and takes away all your filters... But no it gets worse... Android app does the same thing when you press back on your phone!  
[https://ibb.co/stmLSfB](https://ibb.co/stmLSfB) (Notice how I was in the A- Z Filter category with all Disney content and scrolled way trough half the content to reach movies with the M)

[https://ibb.co/GHbbx1j](https://ibb.co/GHbbx1j) (Back to movies home page with default filters and lost library)

\- Random crashes and bugs. Nothing else to say then it's very unstable sometimes.- For some reason they add very complex customization for subtitles when you press for subs and then go to the settings icon. Wrong place to give us to much choice and customization. [https://ibb.co/fQRGf7q](https://ibb.co/fQRGf7q)

\- So this might look minor to people overseas but since this is an Netherlands exclusive. Why don't we have any dubbed movies in Dutch for our kids to understand? These dubbed versions have existed for decades I grew up watching my favorite Disney movies in dutch as a small kid on VCR and now they bring out a service and content to a single country with a limited library but don't put an extra audio track for dutch? How stupid is that? What does that mean if they go worldwide with this? Will only English and American kids be able to understand the cartoons and classics until Disney fixes this?

\- No trailers or introductions for movies. Even new ones don't seem to have it.

\- No intro skip which aint that much of a big deal but this is Disney we are talking abou.

\- No Auto play next episode (Yet)

\- You know how you go in a Family Netflix account and somehow Netflix completely understands how each person has different tastes in movies and has a way different home page. Well Netflix doesn't have any way to interact with the content shown to you. No thumbs up, No thumbs down, No stars, No ratings. Absolutely nothing which tells any of the profiles apart (which don't let you choose custom avatars just a small selection of Disney related avatar characters.) Only thing you can do is turn on parenting mode for kids accounts so they don't end up watching any content outside of their age.

\- No smart TV Apps (LG, Android TV, Samsung, Sony, Chromecast, Apple TV)

Look guys, don't get me wrong. This is Disney and this is a beta test in a country probably not so important to some of you all, and I know 90% of this list will probably be fixed within the next year but I can't stop but think that a couple 1000's of people at Disney or even somebody specific in general decided to give this shitty product the green light. It CLEARLY wasn't ready. And from all the countries they chose, they chose the country with the biggest critics, attention to detail, technology advanced experts and blazing fast internet to test their service and expect to get the word out positively?

No thanks, what they brought out is completely unfinished and they won't make it before launch to fix ALL these issues. With such a shitty streaming platform I finally realize how amazing Netflix actual is and start appreciating it much more.

I love Disney and I really hoped this would make an end to my subscriptions on all my other platforms. But who here wants to pay just for Marvel, Star Wars and Disney Classics? We want some special TV Shows, movies the whole VAULT to be open to public. There are classics so old in such shitty VCR quality to the public while Disney is sitting their asses on blu ray quality edition they never brought out. Why would you not just Open the damn vault and let everybody enjoy. Why not add all content of Fox and HULU on the platform. Disney owns everything but is trying to sell us just the Disney classics for now. We need CONTENT CONTENT CONTENT.

Perhaps next year I will look proud but for now I am a very disappointed customer who will probably apart from revisiting some Marvel movies not bother opening the Disney+ app again for the remainder of my 2 year subscription deal until they add more and fix the list!

Disney what did you do to Disenchanted???,"My review and its a bit long. I partly blame Chapek for giving next to no money for the budget and it shows. This film was a made for tv Disney 30 minute show that was merely stretched out to a 2 hour long movie. It did not look like a movie that would be in theaters. It never really knew what it was. The costuming, the scenery, the limited locations all played into the mid 2000s made for TV feel. It was Descendants with a different plot. This could have been done so much better if we had competent screen writers who carried over the love and care from the first movie. The music was the single biggest letdown of all. FAR TOO MUCH EXPOSiTION. Songs should complement the plot, not be a main driver to get us to the next scene. I can quote Enchanteds songs by heart. In this one I remember none of the melodies and no lyrics at all. Love Power or the ""Badder"" duet were decent sounding, but the lyrics were SOOOO BAD as if a 12-year-old who got genuinely bored with the assignment just rushed to put stuff down. It's like they thought, ""Hey wouldn't it be fun if they sang the dialogue instead of speaking it?"" Idina sounded great as always but that song they gave her was just ick. Disenchanted trips over its own weight. It tries to do too many little subplots instead of focusing on one or 2 and doing them well. Giselles husband was basically turned into the prince from the first movie, and it just didn't fit. Maya Rudolph the ""Queen"" I felt did well enough in spite of the script holding her back and I loved her as the judge in The Good Place. 

Giselle had a new baby and they could have done more with that but it just felt like ""Oh by the way, I had a baby......MOVING ON!!""  I would have loved the plot to be her focusing too much on the new baby through the film while being unaware she was alienating and neglecting her older daughter, thus making her more a ""Stepmother"" she didn't want to be, with of course some magic along the way. Maybe Morgan could have used the wand to wish for her mothers attention and it would turn her slowly into a obsessively dominating overprotective helicopter parent that Morgan must then fix. Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel, etc...again brought their game to portraying the characters well but they were dragged down by just badly paced dialogue and not well written. It was slow where it shouldn't have been and it was too rushed where it should not have been. It didn't take you on a journey and let you discover along the way, it launched you to your destination and you just had to accept it. Its like Enchanted was going on a road trip with your buddy and you didn't quite know the destination but thats the fun, and Disenchanted felt like you bought a ticket on a city bus with a preplanned route and you will like it and deal with it.

Disney needs to improve their service for those of us with no broadband internet.,"There are MANY of us living in rural areas with no broadband internet available but we’d still like to enjoy Disney +.  Our problems could be solved with a few simple fixes. 

I rely on HughesNet for my internet service. Hughesnet is not reliably capable of streaming video. 

I have the following devices that work with Disney +: Desktop PC, MacBook Pro, a smart TV, PS4, X-Box, Apple TV4K and an iPhone. 

Since I can’t reliably stream with poor broadband, then all of the above devices are useless with Disney +.  That leaves me to downloading and watching offline that Disney advertised as unlimited and unrestricted. However, downloading is only allowed via the iPhone. And once downloaded, there is the problem of connecting the iPhone to the TV. 

Very frustrating process. 

Solutions:

1. Allow better connectivity of phones to TVs such as the Apple AV adapter. 

2. Fix issues with Apple TV 4K. (The Mandalorian will not play via Airplay)

3.

The lack of parental controls is completely mind boggling for a service this large.,"Yes, I'm well aware you can set up a kids profile with only access to little kids shows, but the inclusion of Marvel (which I, an adult, love) is a huge can of worms for parents of tech savvy little kids.  There is nothing to keep kids from just turning off the kids only profile or switching profiles, and **my almost 4 year old knows how to switch a netflix profile**.

It should not be this hard when Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon, etc. all allow you to set an access code and tie it to specific content levels.  You can't put mickey mouse next to Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or Thor: Ragnarok and not be able to say one of those isn't OK. 

Come on, Disney.  You're better than this.

DisneyPlus Streaming Service (Opinion),"So I scrolled through a bit of this subreddit, and looked at some of the hot and new posts. Most of the posts seem to read like marketing material instead of actual human interactions. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't been on Reddit very much, or if this is more just exclusive to this subreddit's ecosystem.

Outside of the subreddit, the actual streaming service doesn't seem all that great to me. The UI is  clunky (not as bad as Amazon Prime, but that's a low bar), there's no reviews available on the app for any shows or movies to avoid wasting the viewers time and expectations, I mostly just get recommendations for the same Disney properties I've seen dozens of times already, and even with the lower price comparison to Netflix it just doesn't seem worth it. I think the only real reason I keep this subscription is just to watch the three new shows that interest me when they come out since almost all of Disney's 2020 movie releases were just bad.

I feel as though I'm paying $8 a month for 3 shows that release weekly for some reason, a bunch of older movies I've already seen, painfully childish cartoons that don't have any subtext in them to entertain anyone over the age of 12, the occasional documentary about nature or something, Jeff Goldblum who is a national treasure, and whatever their Disney+ exclusive movies were supposed to be. If Disney could just hurry up and incorporate all their acquisitions into one streaming platform with one overall cost, then it might actually be worthwhile. Even then, the Mandalorian season finale reveal of a CG mask on a stunt guy instead of just a recasting after the flak Disney got for doing it in a movie was surprising in a bad way. I also recognize that COVID really put the kibosh on their launch plans, but man, is it just painful. 

A good metaphor for Disney+ in my mind is like making a PowerPoint presentation that you think needs to be done by Friday, starting at a reasonable time to finish by Friday, finding out on Tuesday that it needs to be ready by Wednesday, scrambling to finish the presentation, filling the last half of the slideshow with MS Paint drawings, barely coherent points, and a few slides from a different presentation you gave 10 years ago to pad the numbers, and expecting to keep your job after making the presentation.",0,0.48,8,Themousemonopoly,:US: US,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1613190972.0,False,False,False,2021-02-13 04:36:12,so i scrolled through a bit of this subreddit and looked at some of the hot and new posts most of the posts seem to read like marketing material instead of actual human interactions im not sure if its because i havent been on reddit very much or if this is more just exclusive to this subreddits ecosystem outside of the subreddit the actual streaming service doesnt seem all that great to me the ui is clunky not as bad as amazon prime but thats a low bar theres no reviews available on the app for any shows or movies to avoid wasting the viewers time and expectations i mostly just get recommendations for the same disney properties ive seen dozens of times already and even with the lower price comparison to netflix it just doesnt seem worth it i think the only real reason i keep this subscription is just to watch the three new shows that interest me when they come out since almost all of disneys movie releases were just bad i feel as though im paying a month for shows that release weekly for some reason a bunch of older movies ive already seen painfully childish cartoons that dont have any subtext in them to entertain anyone over the age of the occasional documentary about nature or something jeff goldblum who is a national treasure and whatever their disney exclusive movies were supposed to be if disney could just hurry up and incorporate all their acquisitions into one streaming platform with one overall cost then it might actually be worthwhile even then the mandalorian season finale reveal of a cg mask on a stunt guy instead of just a recasting after the flak disney got for doing it in a movie was surprising in a bad way i also recognize that covid really put the kibosh on their launch plans but man is it just painful a good metaphor for disney in my mind is like making a powerpoint presentation that you think needs to be done by friday starting at a reasonable time to finish by friday finding out on tuesday that it needs to be ready by wednesday scrambling to finish the presentation filling the last half of the slideshow with ms paint drawings barely coherent points and a few slides from a different presentation you gave years ago to pad the numbers and expecting to keep your job after making the presentation,disneyplus streaming service opinion,1

I'm shocked how Disney -the biggest movie producer in history- can have such a bare bones and poorly made streaming service in 2019-2020.,"The content is ridiculously good and the menu looks ""pretty"". But that's pretty much it. Basic functions are missing, in a time when you thought the whole ""TV/Movie streaming"" service was figured out.

- The service doesn't remember what you were watching.
- The service doesn't remember where you paused!!
- There is no thumbnail fast-forward or rewinding, so you need to just try to remember how much you were watching in a movie.
- The choice of profile icons are anemic.

And many other problems, even security issues like lack of 2-step verification. You even put in the password ONCE the first time, and don't need to confirm it when you're setting it up THE FIRST TIME.

Even YouTube knows where I've stopped when watching something. But here, if I'm watching a movie, hit back, and try to jump back into a movie, it starts it back at 00:00!

It just seems that Disney with all its money, just provided a library and a movie player. Period. These are the richest mofos in the history of entertainment and they provide us with a basic AF movie player, and call it a streaming service. How long did they have to figure this out? This is not just because it's ""the early days"". It's no longer early days. Netflix, Hulu and Prime have been doing that for what, a decade or more?

Just shockingly low effort and unexpected.

This Streaming Service is for Super Big Fans,"Just want to share some experience: I signed up for the trial 3 days ago knowing that they have limited titles. While I have been enjoying Disney movies in the past, I found so far that this streaming service is not for a casual fan like me. Maybe for kids (or even adults) who like to watch a title multiple times. 

Again, I'm not blaming it for the lack of titles because I expected that going in, I'm just curious to see how they will be doing in the near future. The 7 dollar price tag at least helps them. Also I think the optional bundling with Hulu and ESPN+ is smart (what do you get with ESPN+ btw?).

[Hot Take] Disney+ Hotstar is Disney giving Southeast Asians and Indians the middle finger; or: Why Disney+ Hotstar will cost Disney more money than just releasing the real Disney+ in developing country,"Disney made Disney+ Hotstar as an inferior service to the real Disney+ so that people in developing/third-world countries could get Disney+ at a cheaper price.

Unfortunately, the cutbacks they have made to Disney+ Hotstar are so drastic that Disney probably lost more money by not giving third-world countries the full Disney+.

What I see as a dick move here is that Disney thinks people in developing countries would happily pay for an inferior product because they are desperate, by giving these people worse-quality streams than bootleg torrents taken from the real Disney+. This is most noticeable in Southeast Asia, as everyone in Southeast Asia who has Disney+ except Singapore got the Hotstar version.

The cutbacks on Disney+ Hotstar can be seen as Disney making a cheaper service for developing countries, if they hadn't just made the ad-supported option for the US. And this is Disney giving the finger because they don't think people in poorer countries deserve the real Disney+. I'm pretty sure that when Eastern Europe gets Disney+, they will get the real Disney+ even if they are developing countries just like India and most of Southeast Asia.

The only plus that Hotstar gets is local content but even then, Disney has been making international content for Disney+. In fact, one of their most popular shows is the KDrama Snowdrop, which has rivalled the Marvel Studios and Star Wars shows worldwide. The Hotstar content could easily be released under Disney+ Star.

I am worried when Disney+ Hotstar is the Disney+ in the Philippines, especially since that would just make Filipinos pirate more. And the Philippines is already one of the biggest countries in terms of piracy, with Filipinos even making bootlegs of Disney+ shows before any hint of Disney+'s official launch is given.

Look at Netflix, they have the real Netflix everywhere in the world. Even if Netflix is losing money, at least they are a bit more honest than Disney.

Steamboat Willie,"I have been watching a lot of D+ over the last few weeks. I’m curious about why some shows and movies have clear statements about sensitive issues or behaviors such as tobacco use or racism, yet Steamboat Willie seems immune from such acknowledgements, despite the rapelike treatment of Minnie (lifting her by a hook in her underpants) and animal abuse (stepping on a cat and swinging it by its tail, ripping baby pigs from their mother and playing music from her breast areas).

Verdict: Is Disney+ worth it?,"Today is the day: The long-awaited [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/) is here! It’s being released in the USA, Canada and The Netherlands today, next week in New Zealand and Australia and in March in even more countries like Germany, the UK, France, Italy and Spain. I have been able to use it for two months here in the Netherlands and in these two months, I have watched an entire series and about 20 movies. I have tested it extensively and here’s my verdict on *Is it worth it?*

Right after the release, I made a *blog post about my first few days testing Disney+* and my conclusion was that Disney+ is amazing. It was missing a few features back then, features like skipping intros and a Samsung Smart TV app, but they fixed these.

The big pro about Disney+ is the huge collection. Not everything can be found there, but movies which I forgot even existed can be found! They’re still busy uploading its newest movies. Dumbo was released last week and Captain Marvel the week before, and today Avengers: Endgame.

# The big question: Is Disney+ worth it?

There are a few reasons why you should take a subscription to Disney+ and why you shouldn’t. It has got to be worth paying the money for and I don’t think it’ll fit everybody. Answer these questions below and you should be able to make your decision whether to subscribe or not. My personal answer: **YES!**

#### Do you like Disney movies and series?

Obviously, it would be a waste of money if you would get Disney+ but you don’t even like Disney. It’s only worth the money if you are, even a tiny bit of, a Disney fan.

#### Do you have kids that like Disney?

If you don’t like Disney but if your kids might like it, I would definitely get Disney+. The kids won’t have another streaming service to watch Frozen, The Lion King or any other animated Disney movie. I wouldn’t buy DVD’s or Blu-Ray’s, they’re far much expensive than the huge collection of Disney movies available on Disney+.

#### Do you have enough free time?

If I’m in doubt whether to buy something or not, I ask myself the question if it’s worth it. If you don’t know if you have the time to watch a lot of Disney+ content, I really don’t know if it’s worth it.

#### Can you watch Disney+ on your TV?

It would be a waste of money if you’re only going to watch on your PC or mobile device. I’m not able to install an app on my Smart TV, but I can watch Disney+ on my TV through an HDMI cable. I don’t know if it’s a big deal for you guys, but I wouldn’t want Disney+ only on my laptop or mobile phone.

#### Are you excited for the new shows and series only available on Disney+?

If you are: Then HELL to the YES take that subscription! These shows will only be available on Disney+, so if you’re as excited as me to watch High School Musical: The Musical: The Series or maybe The Mandalorian or Loki (later next year): Subscribe right away!

#### Are you a Marvel fan?

Almost all Marvel movies and shows are available on Disney+. Phase 3 got closed off with Spiderman: Far from Home, but maybe you want to watch all those movies again or the upcoming shows like Loki or Vision and Wanda. They will be available on Disney+.

#### Are you a Star Wars fan?

Same thing goes for Star Wars. All the movies are on there, as well as Lego Star Wars, Star Wars shorts and some animated TV shows.

# Conclusion

"[Unpopular Opinion] Everything Wrong With ""Secret Society of Second-Born Royals""","While ""Secret Society of Second-Born Royals"" is a cute little superhero flick, there are so many logical issues with the ""Royal"" part of the movie that it's almost hilarious.

Here were just a couple of the issues:

1. The setting for the film is a fictional European micronation/city-state named Illyria. From a map in the intro scene, the kingdom is a tiny island nation lying off the coast of Denmark and Germany in the Baltic Sea. So why is the entire Illyrian royal family ethnically Asian? They are all Asian characters, played by Asian actresses, but posing as the royal family of a Scandanavian/German monarchy?? The royals should be Nordic, or at least white, but instead they got a bunch of Asian actresses to star in the movie. Why??
2. Apparently Illyria is a ""kingdom"". It's pretty obvious that Illyria is based on a country like Monaco, a tiny European monarchy.  A European monarchy the size of Illyria would definitely not be called a ""kingdom"". It is far too small to be a kingdom. Illyria should be called a ""principality"" (Monaco), ""duchy"" (these don't exist anymore), or at best a ""grand duchy"" (Luxembourg).
3. The succession rules are all screwed up in the movie. Apparently, the king of Illyria died some years before the start of the movie, but the king's eldest daughter Eleanor didn't immediately become Queen. Instead, the former queen consort Catherine became Queen in her own right and ruled the country until Eleanor turned 18. That's not even close to how it works. An heir ascends the throne immediately after the death of the previous monarch. If he/she is underage then the former queen consort (now queen mother or dowager queen) can serve as a regent. But in no European monarchy does the Queen Consort have any right to claim the throne after the king dies. 
4. Apparently at the end of the movie, the new queen Eleanor agrees to create a parliament in Illyria and ""give the people a voice"", presumably transitioning from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one. That's absolutely absurd. The movie is set in the present day. There are no absolute monarchies in Europe anymore and there hasn't been one since the Russian Empire, which ended in 1917. There is also not a single country in Europe or the entire world that doesn't have a parliament or some kind of legislature. Why is this supposedly modern Western European nation making Renaissance-level political developments?

"Would you be willing to pay an extra monthly to see the latest Disney, Pixar, Marvel, etc. films on Disney+ as they release, rather than going to the cinema to see them?","Disney+ is currently $6.99 and offers a great wealth of content.

Scrubbing of scared property,"Hi all, 

I am writing this someone jokingly, somewhat begrudgingly but for whatever reason Disney has deleted one of my corny childhood favorite films and I do not know why. However the 1994 Disney Angels in the outfield starting a young Joseph Gordon Levitt, Danny Glover, Christopher Lloyd, Adrien Brody, and Matthew McConaughey. This film centers around a father who chooses to abandon his nearly high school aged teenage son at an orphanage and says something along the lines of ‘we can be a family again when the angels win the pennant’. Lo and behold, literal angels start making these stains of players play awesome and they win the pennant only for the dad to show up in court and again disown his own son. I am not sure if the scumbag dad or angels has anything to do with its removal but this movie to me is a timeless classic easily surpassing its cohort Eddie’s Million Dollar Cookoff and nearly achieving the level of excellence of The Luck of the Irish.

Is Disney+ underwhelming and disappointing or is it my imagination?,"I've been using DisneyPlus for a while and our family is thoroughly underwhelmed given how much they're charging for the service. We can't be the only ones.

By comparison both Amazon Prime and Netflix offer a superior experience with non-blockbuster, thoughtful programming. The excuse I've seen is that Disney is new to the game so they haven't had time to develop 'original' programming. To that I respond with: WHAAAAAAT?!

Hasn't Disney been in the business of creating or buying 'original' programming for the better part of a century?

Sure they don't have the Disney blockbusters but, how often do you watch a block buster? Once!

And, everything else is just kids programming. How many parents want their kids watching **more** TV?

"Your thoughts on ""Encanto"" (2021)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oczjugnzvsmb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=625b8cd76cf56861bad5f24a95e1d258486a5632

**Overview**

Released during the reign of COVID, *Encanto* enjoyed just thirty days of theatrical exclusivity before being released (at no premium) on Disney+. It found an audience on the streaming platform, however, and became widely successful and acclaimed, due in no small part to its hit soundtrack. It may not have been met with as much prestige and fanfare as *Frozen* or *Moana*, but I'd say its place among the Disney animated musicals of its era is assured.

**Point by Point**

* As usual, the visuals are amazing and colorful throughout. The opening song, 'The Family Madrigal', is a good way of introducing the various members of the clan and their special abilities. I did have to turn on subtitles in order to understand the lyrics, however.
* Grandma Alma has been through a lot. When her children were just babies, she and her husband had to flee some unspecified coup or revolution, and her husband was killed. The miracle occurred then, and created a safe place for the fleeing peasants to live. She's been holding tightly onto that ever since, afraid of it slipping away, and she's reached the point where the magic and the gifts have become the point of it all; the family must serve the miracle, rather than the other way around. She runs the family like a corporation, and applies her family's gifts and talents where she believes they'll do the most good for the community. Thus, the super-strong Luisa spends her days fetching runaway donkeys and holding up collapsing buildings, and Isabela – seen as the “golden child” - is pressured into an arranged marriage for the sake of more offspring with more miraculous powers. Meanwhile, Bruno, Alma's own son, ultimately chooses exile because his power to see the future is unpredictable and problematic.
* As the movie begins with young Antonio about to receive his gift (which turns out to be the ability to communicate with animals), we get a good look at how it all works. Each member of the family receives a huge, magical room (extradimensional in nature, as each room appears bigger than the entire house) that reflects their special gift. Mirabel, of course, never got one, and it's easy to relate to her. She overcompensates in her daily life, trying so hard to serve the family in any way she can, while feeling like she's less special than everyone else around her. Her song, 'Waiting on a Miracle', which she performs as everyone gathers around and celebrates Antonio, conveys the appropriate feelings of longing and disappointment. I really did feel sorry for her here.
* Luisa and Isabela both have great character development songs, with 'Surface Pressure' and 'What Else Can I Do?' respectively. I'm not sure why 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' was such a hit. It's just okay, it's no 'Let It Go'. Bruno is an interesting character, though, and likable; quirky, in a Jeff Goldblum sort of way. It's sad that he's been living in the walls for about a decade and no one has noticed.
* Mirabel's reconciliation with Alma at the river is a good moment. All along it's seemed as though Alma has regarded Mirabel as an emblem of failure and bad fortune, even if she didn't mean to, so it's nice to hear her give Mirabel some validation. She realizes now that she's been missing the point lately, and has been sacrificing the family to feed the miracle, but Mirabel reassures her in turn, pointing out that the miracle happened *because* of Alma.

**In Conclusion**

*Encanto* is fun, colorful, and dramatic, with good characters and good songs, and it handles the subject of a large, quirky family a lot more capably than *Meet the Robinsons* does. I don't quite rank it an S, but there's no question it belongs among the Greats.

Kinda expected more from Disney+ / Ranting,"For a streaming service from Disney, which has enough money to be the rights of absolutely everything and expects people to pay more, I really expected more.
Seems like the disney+ Site (at least when using Chrome) has the shitiest UI I've ever seen.
I can't skip more than 10seconds with the skip buttons without it having to load every 10seconds on the way (no double clicks to skip 20, you gotta wait first). I can't watch anything as long as my extension for learning a new language is still running (which only translates text if I right click on some, which doesn't really interfer with the site whatsoever). The whole site keeps completly reloading every single time you go back and you have to scroll your way back in every single time.
If I select marvel, the same shows appear in every row, even though scrolling down enough, reveals that there are enough shows to actually fill the screen with different ones.

The whole site feels like it would take 1 person 5minutes to set it up. Did they spend the rest of the money on bonuses for the disney overlords? And making it harder for me to chose a different show than they placed on first place in every single fucking row and not allowing any extensions at all in order to be able to see the shows you already paid for. It feels just as fashist as people always say Disney is..
Still. I expected more.


Edit: Somehow I feel like most comments agree with me, yet I'm being downvoted. Probably a lot of disney bots or some of you just don't wanna admit how shitty the site is you're paying for.

"""Not Coming To Disney+"" Articles are massively inaccurate","I noticed some things weren't available, like Dave The Barbarian, so I started combing through a few articles posted online about other content not available for streaming.  What I find was surprising.  At least 3 websites have huge lists of things they claim aren't available to steam.  Yet right of the bat, I noticed those lists were incredibly wrong. 

This is not a compete list, but here are just some movies I noticed ""are not on Disney +"" that, well, actually are on Disney +.  I don't know who's making these lists but I actually physically found each of these and even started watching them to test.

John Carter, Tarzan 1 and 2, Mary Poppins Returns, Ralph Breaks The Internet, Incredibles 2, Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers Infinity War, Holes, Beauty And The Beast (2017), Pirates Dead Men Tell No Tales, Into The Woods, Wrinkle In Time, Christopher Robin, Planes, Planes Fire and Rescue, Franken Weenie, Coco, Up, The Jungle Book (2016), Cinderella (2015), Million Dollar Arm, MacFarlane USA, Tomorrow Land, Lone Ranger, Prince of Persia, Alice Through The Looking Glass, Mighty Ducks films, Homeward Bound 1 and 2, Cool Runnings, George of the Jungle 1 and 2, The sorcerers apprentice, National Treasure 1 and 2, Dumbo (2019), Maleficent, Doug

All these movies show up and work for me.  Just thought I should set the record straight here.

are you able to think of any Disney+ shows that represent female bodies as not thin or skinny? are you able to think of any Disney+ shows that are about being healthy? disney would likely produce those shows in the future,"im trying to find out what perpetuated 'skinny' culture. this is a very new development in world history. it was not always like this. i was listening to the best authors of eating disorders, which is a life-death issue, and one mom mentioned how she was never affected by  'skinny' culture and that was due to the culture that she was from

i was looking at some anime girl (know nothing about anime, but other ppl know) and i started to be conscious of how unhealthily skinny she was. so i was thinking to what was the largest media impact that started this  'skinny' culture, and i think it  had to be disney. Japanese-made anime seems to have been influenced by disney. after the world wars, the usa invested a significant amount of money into japan, so the anime industry likely blew up in japan somewhere after this point in history

* for disney what made the animators make the girls skinny?  and why did they do that for?
* was disney influenced by the golden age of hollywood and marilyn more? or was it the other way around?
* marilyn monroe  was a large influence of blondness, but that couldnt have been the main thing since there were other popular hollywood stars like audrey that were brunette or black haired. so blondness is likely due to disney culture since werent most or all of disney princesses early on blond? but this part is about blondness and not skinny culture

"Is it me, or is disney+ lacking in features?","I'm from the Netherlands and grabbed Diney+ to take advantage of the extra long trial period and to see what I want to replace Netflix with due to their dwindling content quality & quantity.

And to be honest, I'm a little underwhelmed. And I'm wondering if there's other people who've had a similar experience.

First off there's not a lot of content, the amount of content on Netflix has been declining, but Disney+ seems to offer a lot less. It's nice to have the Marvel movies and the disney classics. But it's not going to keep me subscribed when my trail period runs out.

Secondly there's a lot of features lacking on their service. It doesn't seem to keep track of what I'm watching, whenever I start a new show/movie or even when I continue playing one the language will flip back to Dutch and/or forget which subtitles I'm using.

And finally, I just noticed that when my kids were watching Ducktales the pilot episode was placed as episode 3 in season 1.

All in all I am a bit dissappointed.

&#x200B;

Oh and of course Avengers Endgame only comes to the service AFTER the trial period ends.

I am sick and tired of Disney Plus constantly recommending me movies or TV shows you couldn't pay me to watch,"I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but every time I watch a movie, without fail (or with all the fail depending on your perspective) Disney Plus plops a movie I have no interest in watching up on the screen. Even on the main page it tries to push movies I haven't watched that I don't plan to watch. Maybe there's some hidden feature I don't know about to keep movies I'm uninterested in from constantly being recommended to me, but I've yet to find it. You would think with as big of a platform as Disney Plus and being ran by such a wealthy company, they would be able to program an algorithm that could better learn what movies and TV shows interest me, but it seems like instead of going that route, they opted for the algorithm that goes ""Oh, he hasn't watched this yet....WE'RE GONNA MAKE HIM WATCH IT"". That's another thing that irks me, even if I set up a ""playlist"" of the movies that DO interest me, and set it to auto play, it never automatically goes to the next movie on that list....instead it wants me to watch The Rescuers because I just watched The Great Mouse Detective and they both have mice, or it wants me to watch a crappy live action remake of the movie I just watched.

Why even have auto-play as a feature when it never works? Why do they insist on trying to make me watch a bunch of garbage I wouldn't even let my kids watch?

Don't get me wrong I love Will Smith but how many times do I have to not watch the live action remake before they get the picture that I don't want to watch it?  


I should add I use Disney Plus on my PS4 so maybe the PS4 version is just busted or something, but if Netflix is perfectly capable of recommending stuff with accuracy, or I don't know, actually friggin' autoplaying, I don't see why it can't work on Disney Plus.

Why She-Hulk was the final straw in canceling my Disney+ subscription," In the not so distant past Disney would be considered by most Americans as wholesome family entertainment. Yes the left would knock it for dated historical portrayal of women, but for the most part it was somewhat wholesome. Most comic books in the Marvel genre of superheroes also fit the bill historically – they showed good overcoming evil and it was relatively clear that we all wanted to be good.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of their offerings now are promoting behaviors that are blurring the lines between good/evil and socially acceptable behavior and the results are simply anti-family. I honestly really liked the old She-Hulk comic book and the wittiness of the character and like everyone else was hoping that this would be a great series. I wanted to watch with my daughter about a smart strong female character and maybe pull Disney out of the recent series of trash (e.g. the grotesque Sneakarella where the main moral lesson was that people of color should judge others based on their shoes). She-Hulk has the potential to be awesome so it infuriates me that there was so much wrong with the first episode I can't watch it my children. **Disney and marvel seem to have forgotten that superhero shows are supposed to be for kids - and that the heroes are supposed to be people we look up to and want to emulate.** This list of things that were wrong with this episode are almost too many to mention but here is a summary:

&#x200B;

1. Normalizing relativist views on sexual deviancy: Having prostitutes in a bar assume that Jennifer (after a car accident) had been the victim of domestic abuse by either a man, homosexual lover, or they (unsure if this meant polygamy or the new group of individual people that self-identify as they)...rather than be in a car accident.  
 
2. Encouraging and demonstrating alcohol abuse and binge drinking by having two super heroes do it on screen, pan to a fraternity-like collection of empty bottles and having Hulk (remember a hero) set up a bar to drink alone.  
 
3. Modeling physical family physical assault and physical abuse by having Hulk (a hero) 	physically beating on his female cousin, pushing her off a cliff, etc...and then another hero return in kind.  
 
4. Encouraging and demonstrating inappropriate gestures (the bird) by a hero (She-Hulk).  
 
5. Mocking those that wish to remain celibate when making fun of Captain America for being a virgin.  
 
6. Encouraging promiscuity and sexual irresponsibility – revealing that Captain America had lost his virginity in what could not have been a married relationship.  
 
7. Encourages the delusion that to be good at something you do not need to train. Why not show She-Hulk working hard and getting better rather than have her magically proficient at everything immediately?  
 
8. Then the worst: Mocking the idea that those with great power have great responsibility - which both takes away one of the core ethical/moral lessons of early Marvel Comics and Stan Lee,  and gives a free pass to those in power today (e.g. political or economic).  
 

In short, Disney and now Marvel are directly undercutting conventional family values to offer up relativistic morals and edgy content for children. None of this garbage should be fed to kids watching a superhero TV, nor was any of it necessary to the plot or character development and of course, it did not exist in the comic books.",0,0.41,10,chimchiminey23,DisneyPlus,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1660996437.0,False,False,False,2022-08-20 11:53:57,in the not so distant past disney would be considered by most americans as wholesome family entertainment yes the left would knock it for dated historical portrayal of women but for the most part it was somewhat wholesome most comic books in the marvel genre of superheroes also fit the bill historically they showed good overcoming evil and it was relatively clear that we all wanted to be good unfortunately the vast majority of their offerings now are promoting behaviors that are blurring the lines between goodevil and socially acceptable behavior and the results are simply antifamily i honestly really liked the old shehulk comic book and the wittiness of the character and like everyone else was hoping that this would be a great series i wanted to watch with my daughter about a smart strong female character and maybe pull disney out of the recent series of trash eg the grotesque sneakarella where the main moral lesson was that people of color should judge others based on their shoes shehulk has the potential to be awesome so it infuriates me that there was so much wrong with the first episode i cant watch it my children disney and marvel seem to have forgotten that superhero shows are supposed to be for kids and that the heroes are supposed to be people we look up to and want to emulate this list of things that were wrong with this episode are almost too many to mention but here is a summary normalizing relativist views on sexual deviancy having prostitutes in a bar assume that jennifer after a car accident had been the victim of domestic abuse by either a man homosexual lover or they unsure if this meant polygamy or the new group of individual people that selfidentify as theyrather than be in a car accident encouraging and demonstrating alcohol abuse and binge drinking by having two super heroes do it on screen pan to a fraternitylike collection of empty bottles and having hulk remember a hero set up a bar to drink alone modeling physical family physical assault and physical abuse by having hulk a hero physically beating on his female cousin pushing her off a cliff etcand then another hero return in kind encouraging and demonstrating inappropriate gestures the bird by a hero shehulk mocking those that wish to remain celibate when making fun of captain america for being a virgin encouraging promiscuity and sexual irresponsibility revealing that captain america had lost his virginity in what could not have been a married relationship encourages the delusion that to be good at something you do not need to train why not show shehulk working hard and getting better rather than have her magically proficient at everything immediately then the worst mocking the idea that those with great power have great responsibility which both takes away one of the core ethicalmoral lessons of early marvel comics and stan lee and gives a free pass to those in power today eg political or economic in short disney and now marvel are directly undercutting conventional family values to offer up relativistic morals and edgy content for children none of this garbage should be fed to kids watching a superhero tv nor was any of it necessary to the plot or character development and of course it did not exist in the comic books,why shehulk was the final straw in canceling my disney subscription,1

Disney should include an aspect ratio adjuster,"Hello. I was looking for a place to leave this piece and here we are. Hopefully, this could get to Disney and it gets implemented. I downloaded the MCU movies on my phone to watch on a car ride, but when I started watching them, I saw that they were extremely zoomed in, way more than they should be. After doing some research, I found that the versions on Disney+ are the 4K Blu-Ray editions, WAY too large for my 16:9 widescreen phone. This got me thinking about the Simpsons controversy when THAT aspect ratio was changed. 

So, what I think should be in place is an adjustment like in old DVD’s where before the film started, you chose either wide screen or full screen and it would change the way you saw the movie. I believe that this type of feature will be very handy for people and ensuring they get the best possible viewing experience.

Early Simpsons episodes completely broken,"Just subscribed on UK launch day looking forward to The Simpsons finally being on a UK streaming service only to be almost immediately left bitterly disappointed.

The early, classic Simpsons episodes aired in 4:3 aspect ratio, but the episodes on Disney+ have been cropped!

The top and bottom of the image is lost due to the video being resized to fill the wider 16:9 aspect ratio.

Speaking as a senior software developer, i honestly wonder how the hell a company as big as Disney let this slip through QA.

What's more, after Googling the issue, I can see US customers reporting this issue as far back as November last year.

4 months and counting, an International launch and yet this is still an issue?

I wish Disney had more content in French for USA based users.,"I wish Disney Plus was more honest about its marketing. They made such a big deal about the availability of content in different languages, but as USA based user I'm not seeing much of anything with French audio available. Even though I own DVD copies of the same content with French audio. It seems odd.

The only reason I purchased 3-years of Disney Plus was to help my 1-year son learn French (My side of the family is French). It blows my mind how inconsistent the language availability on Disney Plus is. You can look up classic films such as Peter Pan, Snow White, and Robin Hood and get completely different results on what languages are available. Even though, all of them have a DVD release with French audio. I messaged Bradley Wilson, the head of Disney Plus to see what his thoughts are because it's such a detriment to many users who are trying to leverage this platform as a way to help their bilingual households enhance their children's language exposure.

OT-ish: Do you see Disney doing this soon?,"Somebody made this claim about Disney 24 days ago:

> Disney's not exactly a fan of the theatrical experience. As much as possible tried to have the control over release. I wouldn't be surprised if they go for the throat and switch everything to their proprietary platform. It would make sense for them as they clash hard with the rest of the artsy crowd. Creating their own self contained ecosystem would probably be a good power play on their part. I know people are going to reply ""Epcot dystopia"" but purchasing their own theater chains would be a way to start introducing disney towns. The reason a company would want to get involved in housing and township is that it gives them premier access to young talent. Increasingly it will be those with gifted abilities that constitute success. As new generations of kids are born you want them to be brought up in your ecosystem, their mastery of your sector contributing to your performance. Which also requires a safe world. In order for talent to blossom. The certainty of safety is imperative.

This is my list of content of what I want to see created for Disney Plus.,"New Shows that would be great for Disney Plus:

• Tron Series: This series can expand on the lore and world of Tron much like the short-lived Tron: Uprising.

• Pirates of the Caribbean series: This series can revolve around new characters that explores the seven seas much like The Mandalorian followed new characters and expanded the Star Wars universe.

•Ice Age series: A series that revolves around the whole Ice Age gang.

• Avatar series: This series can revolve around new characters exploring more of Pandora and coming across different tribes. (This one seems like a long shot based on how expensive motion capture might be but I think it can be a great high budget series).

•Firefly continuation: This revival can continue the Firefly story.

•An original Matt Groening animated series: Maybe Disney can hire Matt Groening to do an original animated series in the same way he did for Netflix.

Concern: The magnitide and multitude of incoming Marvel and Star Wars shows could be potentially difficult and hard to follow.,"Personally, I am a huge fan of Marvel and Star Wars, especially the latter and the future couldn't look better. However, many of my family and friends and the general audience don't really follow the franchise through properly such as the timeline of different shows and cameo appearances, such as Ahsoka or Thrawn in The Mandalorian or Valentina that appeared in the end credits of Black Widow who first appeared in TFATWS.

With at least 3-4 TV Series for each franchise coming out each year, and with each studio diving deeper into lore heavy content as send in Loki and The Mandalorian S2, I could potentially see it being difficult for casual audiences to follow. Not only that, the fact that Disney+ is not available in many regions yet leaves out a portion of audiences.

Hence, I would like to suggest that Disney+ streamline their content delivery such that it is easier to follow even for someone who hasn't watched anything before but just want to watch a particular series. Or, they could organise their Marvel and Star Wars content on Disney+  by chronological order with deeper elaboration such that people can choose to watch a subset of movies and series. (Eg. Sequel Trilogy in Star Wars + Star Wars Resistance + Visions Episodes that take place during this era)

Who is Disney Plus for exactly?,"I’ve been wondering who Disney Plus is making content for. When it first came out, I remember hearing that it would be exclusively for children and families. That there would be no R rated or adult themed content. 

But they have had the Simpsons from the very beginning and the Simpsons is not really for kids. Marvel movies are usually PG-13 and not appropriate for all ages. 

The main thing that makes me wonder is The Right Stuff. This original series portrayed a lot of scantily clad women, men cheating on their wives, sex scenes (or moments leading up to sex, not simulated sex scenes), lots of drinking alcohol and general behavior that is unbecoming for the characters/not setting a good example for children. 

I have no problem with any of it. It was a good show. But definitely adult-themed. I just don’t understand why Disney would produce this show while simultaneously killing the Lizzie McGuire revival because it was too adult themed. 

The show was going to feature Lizzie going through a divorce because her husband cheated. I assume it would focus on her raising her kids while having a career and also dating and would probably show the impact divorce has on kids, while also being a funny family show. (By the way, is the script available to read online? I’d like to read it!)

I’m also aware that Disney chose to release Love, Victor and High Fidelity on Hulu because those shows didn’t fit their family-friendly model. I’ve only seen Love, Victor, but didn’t find it especially adult themed. It featured teen LGBTQ characters, so it definitely feels like Disney is saying LGBTQ characters are not family friendly. (I’m also aware of the gay character and modern family dynamics on Andi Mack so I know they’re somewhat okay with these themes.)

I just don’t understand how they decide what is and isn’t family family friendly. I don’t love the idea of Disney cornering the market on “family friendly” content when their values seem to differ widely from my values and the values I would want to share with my kids. 

To go back to The Right Stuff vs Lizzie McGuire, we could interpret it as Disney being willing to portray men having realistic lives while not wanting to portray women having realistic lives. Or that it’s okay to see husbands cheating from the men‘s perspective but not the wife’s perspective.

How can they justify the hypocrisy? Or is there no hypocrisy and I’m misinterpreting? Is Disney Plus supposed to be exclusively for kids and families or not?

She-Hulk twerking scene is working,"DISCLOSURE: I didn't watch a single episode of She-Hulk because I'm waiting for a full season to drop so that I can binge watch it. I don't know absolutely anything happening in She-Hulk other than the twerking scene and a fact that people don't really like the show.



POST: She-Hulk twerking scene is the first scene in a while that I saw all over reddit and social media. Disney knew what will happen and they did it for publicity. Having a perfect TV show is not as beneficial to a company as you might think because people are more likely to talk about something cringe rather than how good a TV show is. Their point of view is would we rather have 1-2 posts a day saying how good a show is or 20-30 posts a day about people saying how cringe that twerking scene is (BTW yes I think that it's cringe). Disney's goal is to get as many posts about a specific show outside of related subreddits (for She-Hulk it would be outside of Disney and Marvel subreddits) because a person who's regularly visits this subreddit most likely already have Disney+ meanwhile if they can get 20-30 posts a day on subreddits which are not directly related to Disney and Marvel maybe (10%-20% (absolutely random numbers) of people seeing those posts will like that scene, they will look for a trailer, like the trailer and 30%-40% of those 10%-20% of people who liked that scene will sign up for Disney+. Disney wants more subscribers and we can absolutely expect similar scenes in future shows and movies to boost subscriber count.



DISCLOSURE n2: This is purely objective view. I don't necessarily agree with them.

Disney OUT did themselves,"I would like to discuss the new short on D+ OUT.
But before I get into this let me lay down the lines here. If you have a problem with LGBT, ok you are allowed I have no interest in changing anyone’s mind. But please leave the comments to yourself. You are however welcome to downvote if you desire to be heard. 
          I would like this to be a deeper post though then just “I liked it”. There was some odd stuff, but also some powerful stuff and I wanted to use this opportunity to help educate those interested. If that is not you I would recommend stop reading and have a good day. 

Firstly I will say the body change thing was weird and I think it was to allow our protagonist an inside look. As a gay man the stress of coming out was real and so often you don’t take the jump because of “what if” scenarios that play in your head. It’s anxiety that if not handled(by coming out) just keeps coming back.
We quickly learn that Greg is not out(at least to his parents) and is ashamed of his homosexuality. This is very common... like extremely, as I expect most people know. 
This is where I started to connect with the film. I am sure we can agree relationships are one of the biggest life goals and our parents are generally speaking our most loved and closest family. So to have to hide one from the other is mentally draining among other things. 
We get Greg alone on his bed talking to his dog Jim which is referred to as a girl by the mother, I am not sure why, so if anyone could explain that to me I would appreciate it. Anyways Greg says “he thinks it’s so easy” now this was another connecting point for me. For some it is that easy, but for many we run those “what if” scenarios in our head and when the idea of being disowned, kicked out of your house, abandoned by your friends, and generally shunned from society become possibilities in your head it gets real hard to say. And the fact he couldn’t say it, not even to the dog, that was spot on. It’s all about that self acceptance, and with all those horrible possibilities running in your head you are afraid to even come out to yourself, because then it’s real. 
This fear is so strong he bit his mom to hide the truth from her, they made it clear he was not of sound mind but consumed by the fear. You could see it swallowing him hole. 
Now let’s talk about the climax of the mom talking to the dog outside. This was such a powerful scene. Greg is coming to his senses now but he is still terrified and shows no desire to come out. And here we have this mom who at this point we can all see is a very loving mother, she doesn’t know how to reach her son. I would bet that this scene resonated with a lot of moms out there LGBT issues aside. She starts her speech and Greg is allowing love to conquer his fear, well starting to. You see it’s important for the parents of LGBT to know that we probably know you love us and we probably know you won’t be mad when we come out, but that little bit of fear and doubt is super loud so sometimes we just need to hear it again. 
And then we hear the words out of her mouth, the words that they took a pause before saying to get of on the edge of our seat saying “is she gonna say “he”?” And bam there it is she already knew. This reminds me of the most powerful presentation I have ever been lucky enough to attend. In college we got Judy Shepard to come talk and it was this same kind of power. I honestly feel like this mother is based off her. And something she said to help encourage students to come out is your parents have grown up with you and they probably already know. 😆 it’s so true, most people can connect the dots I suppose. But now that giant huge enormous step no longer has that little doubt holding him back. He knows the outcome and is able to live his life without fear at last. As true Disney we get a happy ending filled with love. And I love the Wheezy Easter egg.

Why do you think 'Turning Red' got into more online dispute than 'Luca' did?,"I haven't seen **Turning Red** yet, but I have a hard time thinking that the animation style is the main cause of this. Yes, both films have more stylized animation styles than other Pixar films do, but that alone doesn't seem to be enough to cause that much online dispute, especially considering that characters in **Turning Red** still retain some extent of ""real human"" proportions while **Luca** practically throws that away straight into the ocean.

Are there people other than me who thinks that some of the Marvel shows on Disney+ will eventually come together to make the Young Avengers?,"It's my opinion that similar to some of the Netflix shows coming together to form the Defenders, some of the child/teenager characters who appear on some Disney+ shows will become the Young Avengers.

Billy and Tommy from WandaVision. I call reality warping multiverse shenanigans will bring them back as Wiccan and Speed.

Isaiah Bradley's grandson Eli from The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, who took the role of Patriot.

Kid Loki from Loki, who like in the comics (from what I can remember) is a separate entity from the regular Loki.

Kate Bishop from Hawkeye.

Infographic: Potential Big 6 Hollywood companies after current M&A," Hypothetically speaking :). With the M&A wave that is going on and wall street initial chatter that Discovery/Warner may also be sold after the merger, what if in the next few years after the eventual consolidation the following (plausible) scenario happens (and we get these 6 Major Hollywood companies)

* Disney and NBCU bid and acquire parts of Discovery/Warner.
* NBCU also acquires AMC and Lionsgate as these are the last major companies remaining (Amazon will be acquiring MGM, Sony is not interested in selling & ViacomCBS doesn't have the scale to compete with NCBU and Disney for the bidding of Warner/Discovery)

&#x200B;

[Potential Big 6 after the current wave of Media Consolidation - Disney, NBCU, Netflix, Amazon, ViacomCBS & Sony](https://preview.redd.it/xzd50lhxmfh71.jpg?width=2280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed268bb276cbae275cee5ab7b78b88b901c945a)

Here's how NBCU and Disney can split the companies (from Warner/Discovery) so as to smoothly pass regulation.

* Disney gets **WarnerBrosTelevision** & NBCU acquire **LionsgateTelevision**
* NBCU gets **AdultSwim** as Disney has **20thCentury Animation**
* NBCU gets **CartoonNetwork** and Disney gets **Hanna Barbera**
* Disney gets **WarnerBrosAnimation** as Universal has **UniversalAnimation**?
* Disney gets **WarnerBrosStudios** as NBCU has **UniversalStudios**
* NBCU acquire **Lionsgate** to compete with Disney's **20thCentury**
* NBCU acquire **Starz** and Disney gets **HBO**
* NBCU acquire **AMC** to compete with Disney's **FX**
* Disney acquires **WWE**. (maybe NBCU can acquire AEW?)
* NBCU acquires majority stake of **Amblin** to compete with **Disney Pictures** (Blockbuster family movies)
* NBCU gets **DC** as Disney has **Marvel**
* NBCU gets **NewLine** as Disney has **Lucasfilm**
* NBCU gets **Discovery** as Disney has **NatGeo**
* NBCU gets **Turner** (& Sports) as Disney has **ESPN**
* Disney gets **CNN** as NBCU has **MSNBC/CNBC**
* Disney acquires **Hasbro** & NBCU acquires **Mattel**.
* NBCU gets **HBOMAX** streaming service (not the HBO brand) and its consumers. Disney already has **Hulu/Disney+** so I don't believe regulatory bodies would allow Disney to buy MAX.

**Note:** This infographic only contains content production brands and not broadcasting/cable brands (USA, Syfy, Bravo, etc) as content brands are the owners of IP normally and this whole M&A is mostly for IP. This infographic also doesn't contain video games brands and includes only mainstream unscripted brands (NatGeo & Discovery)

This may not even be a monopoly as Disney and NBCU can now be competitors of equal footing. Netflix and Amazon already have huge scale. ViacomCBS can be the minnow now. Sony is already a diverse conglomerate as Sony Entertainment is not its bread & butter. And having 5 Streaming services (Disney & NBCU bundle, Netflix, Amazon prime & Paramount+.

Anyone else Canceled Disney plus like me?,"The reason I'm writing this isn't to gloat, but I'm curious if anyone else did the same or is thinking about it. I had Disney Plus since November 2019, and since that time, the problems I've had, didn't change. 

The content either freezes, rewinds automatically, or constantly buffers. The volume is extremely low. Most older films are censored, or in extremely low quality which is unacceptable in today's digital age. And not to mention a massive problem with the addition of new content. 

Where is the Ewok tv movies? The Ewoks cartoon? Droids? There are a million Disney live action movies still not on there like Angels in the Outfield 

Where are the Disney Sunday movies? (Exile, The Last Electric Knight) How about documentaries about the Disney parks and rides?

How long do we think Hamilton will stay on Disney+ ?,"I can't quite explain why, but I had a sinking feeling yesterday that Hamilton may only stay around on Disney+ for a bit, before disappearing into the ""vault"".

I cant imagine passively browsing Hamilton in a few months time for example, just like ""any old film"". 

It feels bigger than that, possibly due to it being a live recording and a cultural zeitgeist.

Opinion: Disney+ should have an option to watch certain mini-series as a movie instead of episode by episode.,"There could be a button next to the watch button that says ""watch as movie""

IMAX Enhanced… I just don’t get it,"I’m all for respecting aspect ratio (IE the way it was filmed and intended to be seen)

But I just don’t get it. I am watching Shang Chi right now - and every single scene I’ve seen at the one hour mark, has done the traditional 16:9 tv format. 

Like, for Knives Out, I know the whole film was made to be that aspect ratio. But when I saw Shang chi in theatres - it wasn’t that aspect ratio. I’m waiting for the moment it actually makes it taller and gives bars on the sides (genuinely I don’t want that, that was just my concerned - what I’m seeing right now is just everything being formatted in the same aspect ratio regardless of whether it was meant to be or not).

Honestly - I feel like it just ruins of the overall experience. Whatever you envision it to be - and then film it to be that - it should be what the audience sees.

Subtitles Inclusivity,"Walt Disney Studios is one of the top five major film studios and controls more money than I can imagine, yet Disney+ has such a limited range of subtitle languages, some shows even lack them entirely. For a studio with such a global reach this seems ridiculous? 

  
The range of dubbed languages is much larger, but will not include all the languages of Disney's audience- it's so much quicker and cheaper to just add subtitles so could cover an even larger range of languages and would be accessible to those with hearing loss.   
I am learning French, and have had no luck finding any French subtitles on Disney+. In desperation I went to Miraculous Ladybug, an actual French show, that still had no French subtitles (although this might be a blessing in disguise for my sanity)

  
I understand that the service has launched relatively recently in comparison to some others, but this still seems unacceptable, especially with recent advances in auto-translate technologies. It may be an issue specifically with my region, but there are obviously still people in my region who speak languages other than English. Maybe there's no financial gain and the big decision-makers would rather put money into projects with more profit, but I think such a massive company has a moral obligation to be as inclusive as possible.

Is Disney still making DVDs? Do you think they will ever stop because of Disney Plus?,"Don't get me wrong, I love them making Blurays and such and dvds with Bonus content (plus the better quality both sound and visual wise on DVD and Bluray), but with the increasing popularity of Disney Plus and with the streaming service being a cheaper and better option economy-wise compared to DVDs overall, I have to start thinking if they ever will come to an end.

I mean with DVDs, Blurays, CDs and other physical media taking up real life space in our homes and the hassle of having to pack them all with us when we leave on holiday (taking up yet more valuable space that could be saved for essentials), is it more of a hassle than we think it is (even for the improved quality)? When we have just our phones or other devices to take with us, bearly taking up any room at all, only needing WiFi and a subscription to basically plug and play, is that better in anyway?

My thoughts is yes. With Disney Plus, you get thousands of content right at your fingertips and only costing you $10-$20 a month, depending on country (and counting Disney Plus Star coming in February). With dvds, sure its a ""pay for it once and get it forever"" deal, but physical media is easily broken by smaller children and as much as people love and are proud to say they will never lose their dvds, it's bound to happen at some point. And when they are broken or dirty, sometimes dvd players or PS4s or such just won't accept them, and then you're stuck.

Anyway, let's have a calm, rational debate about this. What are your thoughts? Also, for bonus content and Special Features on dvds, should they be added to the streaming service or just left on the physical media? I'd love to say my opinion, but it's way too long and boring.

So here's my overview on Disney+ after about 2 months of using it.,"Disney+ is great for watching older and much older content in high quality and being able to relive your childhood is always a blast.

Having 5 well known brands as well as having Fox and ABC content is also a treat.

Although we still are far away from having a strong library of ABC and even more so fox content it's still nice to have and more gets added daily.

Now I do have a gripe that a good amount of Disney XD content still isn't on the service e.g. wander over yonder, kick buttowski, American Dragon: Jake Long etc.

Now the UI is great for the most part, the collections are sort of messed up and a lot of them can only be accessible by link not the actual app which is annoying and inconvenient.

There's some visual glitches at times and sometimes it will crash but it's rare.

The PS4 app is hot garbage and that's all I'm going to say.

Now probably the most meh part about Disney+ is the original line up and the amount of it available.

Now don't get me wrong covid stopped a LOT of these shows in production so I'm not saying it's Disney's fault or anyone else's.

What I will say though for positives is that we got the best thing that's come out from star wars since Disney bought lucasfilms and having the final season for clone wars is definitely a notable addition, also we got a Phineas and Ferb movie and a alien talk show that was surprisingly good.

Also I almost forgot to mention the aspect ratio toggle is only available for Simpsons and nothing else which is disappointing, really wish we got it for other shows.

But overall Disney+ has a impressive back catalog of content all ranging from marvel to Mickey mouse with albeit some important titles missing still, it also has a great looking UI and a extra tab which is rare to see in streaming services.

My thoughts so far as one of the first dutch users,"As you are probably aware, Disney+ launched first in the Netherlands. Like many others I am quite thrilled to start streaming this new platform. Having the privilege of being dutch I thought I'd share my thoughts.

First of all I think Disney has a huge opportunity here to play with the big streaming providers like Netflix and Amazon prime. With the acquisition of Marvel and the Star Wars universes they have the rights of some of the most popular content around. I mean these universes alone are worth the monthly subscription. Along with the Disney classics and the live action remakes of these classics I think they can definitely compete with the big streaming providers. 

However, this platform can only take off if Disney starts releasing apps for all popular platforms. I really don't understand why Disney only provided an Android and iOS app on launch. I read that only 1 in 10 TVs have Android TV and Apple TV is only giving errors. They should at least release native apps for the bigger TV manufacturers.

Am I the only one who finds Disney+ KIND OF bad?,"Ok before I get downvoted, having marvel, star wars, Disney, and pixar in one place is REALLY convenient.

I then watched the clone wars when season 7 came out. Obviously watched mando as well. I think the problem is that there's no reason to keep paying for disney+ month after month when you only go on there once a week. There's nothing to watch and I just find myself on HBO Max and Netflix most days. There's also the fact that they need a lot of features that wouldn't be too hard to add.

**Overview**

Disney's movie history is replete with stories of talking animals, but those talking animals are still living in the world of man. *Zootopia* embraces the concept of animals living in a world that's completely their own, made by them and for them. Disney's own *Robin Hood* would serve as inspiration. In *Robin Hood*, however, the characters don't actually behave like animals, or even really acknowledge that they *are* animals. Every character in *Robin Hood* (with the possible exception of Sir Hiss) could be replaced by a human being and nary a word of dialogue would have to be changed. *Zootopia*, on the other hand, really leans into the concept of a mass population of all sorts of mammals (strangely, there are no birds or reptiles living in Zootopia) trying to get along and function as a society despite their innate differences.

**Point by Point**

* The very first thing we're presented with is the stage play that young Judy Hopps and her friends put on for a talent show, laying out for the audience the dynamics of this society. It's explained, basically, that all animals eventually evolved into humanoids, and the carnivores (or “predators”) made the decision to stop killing the “prey” for food. Surely there must have been some kind of quantum enlightenment along the way, because why would the predators collectively go against their most basic, fundamental instincts and start eating...I dunno, veggie burgers? Protein supplements? Simply electing to let the prey be their equals in this society is an act of incredible benevolence on the predators' part.
* The sprawling city of Zootopia is marvelously and imaginatively conceived. It's not just a generic urban model filled with skyscrapers; it comprises several different habitats and ecosystems, from desert to rain forest to frozen tundra, each catering to the needs of its own population. (This suggests that terraforming and weather manipulation have come a long way indeed in the world of *Zootopia*.) Not only that, but the vast difference in size between animals is accounted for, and gerbils and mice can navigate the city just as easily as giraffes and elephants can.
* Judy Hopps is an extremely likable protagonist; indomitable and optimistic, even in the face of adversity and intolerance. She tries to make the best of being underestimated and assigned to parking patrol, but receives a rude wakeup call when she encounters Nick Wilde, a sly fox who hustles his way through life. Nick is a great character too, and the two of them share a good dynamic. Judy is significantly disenchanted during her second day on the job, but perks up when she has the opportunity to chase a thief through Little Rodentia, in a fast-paced but enjoyable sequence that showcases the juxtaposition between the small and the large. (To the tiny rodents living here, even Judy is like Godzilla.)
* The bit with the nudist animals is fairly clever, precisely because the animals don't look nude to us at all. Judy's cringing with embarrassment and covering her eyes feels completely unwarranted to us. (The area between the spreadeagled legs of the elephant looks unnaturally smooth, however. I'm pretty sure an elephant's genitals would be visible in that position.) The bit with the sloths at the DMV is hilarious, and undoubtedly a highlight of the film. The sequence with Mr. Big is good too, and feels surprisingly fresh, considering how often *The Godfather* has been parodied already.
* Judy putting her foot in her mouth at the press conference shows that even the best of us can be subject to prejudices and bigotries; it's not exclusively the province of mean people. We all have to be introspective. That's a valuable lesson for the kiddies. (It's not a perfect 1:1 comparison, though, because predators really are biologically disposed towards being killing machines. If anything, Nick is denying his biology by *not* eating Judy.)
* The investigation, throughout the film's runtime, is actually pretty basic and procedural, but the colorful, well-realized characters and the imaginative set pieces make it seem otherwise. Though Judy and Nick are doing little more than interviewing witnesses and scrounging for clues, the action is never boring, and it helps that the two play off of each other extremely well. The identity of the villain is a good twist (which seems to be a trend in this era of WDAS movies).

**In Conclusion**

*Zootopia* looks great, and has a lot of great characters and concepts, and delivers a good lesson about the dangers of intolerance and fearmongering. It's a fascinating world that I'd like to see more of. Fortunately, Disney has announced that a sequel is in the works.

Disney+ layout is just horrible.,"While I find Disney+ to look aesthetic, and modern, the way they layout their content is so awful.

Disney pulling an Office Space for billing,"I posted this to twitter a few weeks ago and have not heard anything back on it.  My experience included the following scenario:

I was already a subscriber of the Disney+ 69.99 annual subscription.

I switched over to the ESPN+, Disney+, and Hulu (with ads) bundle for 12.99.

&#x200B;

Disney prorates the 12.99 to 7.16 per month so they can still charge you the 69.99 per year for Disney+

When we do the math:

12.99 \* 12 = 155.88 (per year)

7.16 \* 12 = 85.92 (per year)

Then add the 69.99 = 155.91 (per year)

You'll notice a $.03 different, and I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but if you take that small change and add it up across their subscribers (a Google search shows \~95 million), then 3 cents adds up to quite a bit.  I have not been able to find any other mention of this.  I found out this information talking to Disney support trying to understand my bill and why I'm just not getting billed the 12.99 per month (which I finally am, because I canceled my annual Disney+ in-lieu of the monthly).  Support also said that there were no refunds given for the 3 cent over charge.

For those that don't know ""Office Space"" (US movie version), there's code they write to take fractions of a cent and deposit that into another account.

The Mandalorian Disney Plus series review," 

With a new, highly anticipated season of Disney's ""The Mandalorian"" just days away from premiering on Disney Plus, what better time than now to reflect on the first season of the series and see why so many people are looking forward to the premiere of the second season. First things first, the show is good, many would call it great, and there is a community of Star Wars fans online calling this series the best thing to come from the Star Wars franchise since the original trilogy. Now, it would be unfair for me or anyone who wasn’t around when the original Star Wars trilogy premiered in theaters to make such a statement, but having watched the Mandalorian and the original trilogy I can understand the parallels being drawn between the two. Much like the original Star Wars film trilogy, the first season of the Mandalorian is a fun, exciting adventure with a masterful mixture of levity and gravitas that die-hard Star Wars fans and the average television viewer can enjoy in equal measure.

**Cast**   
The cast of the Mandalorian is not a distinguished line-up of academy award-winning actors, and I couldn't care less. Pedro Pascal, whom many know from his roles as Oberyn “The Viper” Martell in HBO’s Game of Thrones or Javier Peña in [Netflix](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/2018/07/20/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflix)’s Narcos, does another great job playing an independent rogue struggling to do the right thing. That is not to say that he carries the show, former MMA fighter Gina Carano as Cara Dune, a former rebel soldier turned mercenary, and veteran actor Carl Weathers as Greef Karga, the leader of a bounty hunter guild play these recurring roles in the series to perfection. Each casting choice in the Mandalorian serves to help with world-building and making the audience feel as though we are viewing a diverse, living universe without any glaring errors that I could find.

**Plot**  
Ok, I'll try to keep this spoiler-free, but I won’t make any promises so proceed at your own risk. The parallels that the Mandalorian draws to the original Star Wars trilogy of the 1970s is understandable because at its core the Mandalorian is a fun adventure through space. Though, that is only what draws the audience in, what will keep you watching more than anything is the main character, Din Djarin, who is commonly referred to as “Mando”. Compelling, interesting, complex, and shrouded in enough mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat without distracting from the main overarching narrative of the series. Also, the relationships “Mando” has with the other characters both good and bad are always entertaining and interesting. This is especially true for one character that “Mando” encounters early in the series, the character that is with “Mando” most consistently. I am going to give a spoiler alert if you don’t want to know anything about the series at all before watching it. Now, the character I was referring to earlier, the one with “Mando” more than any other is one that I’m sure you’ve seen in countless memes and pictures all over the internet. Yup, I’m talking about the world-famous “Baby Yoda”. The internet fell in love with him because of how cute he looked but his inclusion in the Mandalorian is so much more than a cute face they put on toys (though I’m sure Disney isn’t too mad about that). I refuse to get into specifics because I really want people to experience this for themselves, but “Baby Yoda” serves as the moral center of The Mandalorian, while simultaneously adding something new to the lore of Star Wars. Without “Baby Yoda,” the character arc of “Mando” would not be nearly as interesting or satisfying as it would be without the little, cute, green guy in the series. But more than anything else, the story of The Mandalorian has something that words by themselves cannot do justice. It just feels like Star Wars, more than most Star Wars media has in a long time, that’s why I don’t want to give away any spoilers, it would be a disservice to those reading this because I want everyone who watches ""The Mandalorian"" to be as presently surprised as I was watching the series.

**Worldbuilding**    
 I have mentioned multiple times The Mandalorian ""feeling"" like Star Wars, but the story is not the only reason, it cannot be the only reason. No, a big part of what makes the Star Wars universe unique is that it builds a fictional world that is fantastical and lore-filled that encourages exploration. The Mandalorian masterfully balances those elements while also managing to tell a compelling story. The Mandalorian is also a breath of fresh air because it is one of the few times on-screen that the galaxy's force-sensitive characters have not been the focus and it is one of the few times we have seen the lore of a faction that is not force-sensitive explored. This is not to say I hate the continuous duel between good and evil that the light-side and the dark side of the force are eternally locked in. However, it's interesting seeing how people without superpowers live in such a fantastical world. Also, seeing how these ""regular"" characters react to seeing the force being used by others makes the force feel fantastic and special. Also, the designs of the aliens and the practical effects that bring them to life are just fantastic. There is an unforgettable alien that ""Mando"" meets early in the season that adds both levity and intrigue to the story of that episode and the Star Wars universe. This alien we meet early on is just one of the new aliens introduced in the series that you'll be intrigued by, but The Mandalorian also shows us aliens seen before in Star Wars in a whole new light. But more than anything else the exploration of Mandalorian society and culture is something longtime fans of Star Wars have always wanted, while for newcomers to the universe it will give them a grounded introduction to such a fantastic universe.

The Mandalorian is a great show for the whole family, but it is not perfect. The most consistent issue that I had with the series was that there were times where it could be very predictable. There are betrayals and double-crosses that are Scooby-Doo levels of obvious! These are treated like Chris Nolan level twists when all they'll really do is make you roll your eyes. There is also an issue with consistency with our main character ""Mando' which may add to the eye-roll count. Portrayed from his first moment on screen as a no holds barred, suspicious, intelligent, loner, it seems odd to me how often in the series “Mando” is betrayed and/or tricked. Most of the time is fiercely resistant to change, trust, and extremely protective of ""Baby Yoda"" and his people but there are times where ""Mando"" may give “Baby Yoda” to a stranger, endanger his people, or trust someone who clearly has questionable morals at best. Again I’ll try not to get too specific to avoid spoilers.  Also, there is an interesting idea that a character “Mando” speaks to at the beginning of the season that I wish was explored a bit more in the series. The idea that this character brings up is that the rebels toppling the Galactic Empire did not actually save the galaxy, but only served to destabilize the galaxy and made things worse for average people. It would have been interesting to see this idea explored further as I’m sure there were regular people in the galaxy whose lives were improved by the Galactic Empire and subsequently made worse by the fall of the Galactic Empire. For better or worse, The Mandalorian is a Disney series, which means they are going for mass appeal and unfortunately that means things will be made overly simple and obvious at times in an attempt to keep as many people watching as possible.   
**Overall**    
Watch it. Let me say it again, watch it. Whether you are a Star Wars fan or not,  young or old, this show has something for everyone. Like I said before, The Mandalorian is not going to blow you away like Breaking Bad or The Wire but what it is, is one of the best pieces of Star Wars media produced in the past 20 years. The Mandalorian can also serve as a great introduction for anyone not familiar with the Star Wars universe (which I’m sure series runner and writer Jon Favreau was aiming for when penning the series). So, if you have not already seen The Mandalorian then I suggest you binge season one as soon as possible and then go watch season two when it comes out.

Global,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1603020759.0,False,False,False,2020-10-18 11:32:39,with a new highly anticipated season of disneys the mandalorian just days away from premiering on disney plus what better time than now to reflect on the first season of the series and see why so many people are looking forward to the premiere of the second season first things first the show is good many would call it great and there is a community of star wars fans online calling this series the best thing to come from the star wars franchise since the original trilogy now it would be unfair for me or anyone who wasnt around when the original star wars trilogy premiered in theaters to make such a statement but having watched the mandalorian and the original trilogy i can understand the parallels being drawn between the two much like the original star wars film trilogy the first season of the mandalorian is a fun exciting adventure with a masterful mixture of levity and gravitas that diehard star wars fans and the average television viewer can enjoy in equal measure cast the cast of the mandalorian is not a distinguished lineup of academy awardwinning actors and i couldnt care less pedro pascal whom many know from his roles as oberyn the viper martell in hbos game of thrones or javier pea in netflix narcos does another great job playing an independent rogue struggling to do the right thing that is not to say that he carries the show former mma fighter gina carano as cara dune a former rebel soldier turned mercenary and veteran actor carl weathers as greef karga the leader of a bounty hunter guild play these recurring roles in the series to perfection each casting choice in the mandalorian serves to help with worldbuilding and making the audience feel as though we are viewing a diverse living universe without any glaring errors that i could find plot ok ill try to keep this spoilerfree but i wont make any promises so proceed at your own risk the parallels that the mandalorian draws to the original star wars trilogy of the s is understandable because at its core the mandalorian is a fun adventure through space though that is only what draws the audience in what will keep you watching more than anything is the main character din djarin who is commonly referred to as mando compelling interesting complex and shrouded in enough mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat without distracting from the main overarching narrative of the series also the relationships mando has with the other characters both good and bad are always entertaining and interesting this is especially true for one character that mando encounters early in the series the character that is with mando most consistently i am going to give a spoiler alert if you dont want to know anything about the series at all before watching it now the character i was referring to earlier the one with mando more than any other is one that im sure youve seen in countless memes and pictures all over the internet yup im talking about the worldfamous baby yoda the internet fell in love with him because of how cute he looked but his inclusion in the mandalorian is so much more than a cute face they put on toys though im sure disney isnt too mad about that i refuse to get into specifics because i really want people to experience this for themselves but baby yoda serves as the moral center of the mandalorian while simultaneously adding something new to the lore of star wars without baby yoda the character arc of mando would not be nearly as interesting or satisfying as it would be without the little cute green guy in the series but more than anything else the story of the mandalorian has something that words by themselves cannot do justice it just feels like star wars more than most star wars media has in a long time thats why i dont want to give away any spoilers it would be a disservice to those reading this because i want everyone who watches the mandalorian to be as presently surprised as i was watching the series get all the latest reviews by subscribing worldbuilding i have mentioned multiple times the mandalorian feeling like star wars but the story is not the only reason it cannot be the only reason no a big part of what makes the star wars universe unique is that it builds a fictional world that is fantastical and lorefilled that encourages exploration the mandalorian masterfully balances those elements while also managing to tell a compelling story the mandalorian is also a breath of fresh air because it is one of the few times onscreen that the galaxys forcesensitive characters have not been the focus and it is one of the few times we have seen the lore of a faction that is not forcesensitive explored this is not to say i hate the continuous duel between good and evil that the lightside and the dark side of the force are eternally locked in however its interesting seeing how people without superpowers live in such a fantastical world also seeing how these regular characters react to seeing the force being used by others makes the force feel fantastic and special also the designs of the aliens and the practical effects that bring them to life are just fantastic there is an unforgettable alien that mando meets early in the season that adds both levity and intrigue to the story of that episode and the star wars universe this alien we meet early on is just one of the new aliens introduced in the series that youll be intrigued by but the mandalorian also shows us aliens seen before in star wars in a whole new light but more than anything else the exploration of mandalorian society and culture is something longtime fans of star wars have always wanted while for newcomers to the universe it will give them a grounded introduction to such a fantastic universe what could be better the mandalorian is a great show for the whole family but it is not perfect the most consistent issue that i had with the series was that there were times where it could be very predictable there are betrayals and doublecrosses that are scoobydoo levels of obvious these are treated like chris nolan level twists when all theyll really do is make you roll your eyes there is also an issue with consistency with our main character mando which may add to the eyeroll count portrayed from his first moment on screen as a no holds barred

"Time: The Imagineering Story is ""Strictly for Disney Superfans"" (The Best Original Shows on Disney+—And the Worst)","[Link: The Best Original Shows on Disney+—And the Worst](https://time.com/5728909/best-disney-plus-shows/)

>**Strictly for Disney Superfans**  
>  
>*The Imagineering Story*  
>  
>The most grown-up show in the initial Disney+ lineup, this six-part docuseries—directed by Leslie Iwerks (*The Pixar Story*), with narration by Angela Bassett—traces the history of Walt Disney Imagineering, the in-house creative lab that’s behind the company’s international theme-park franchise and the many Audio-Animatronic wonders that populate them. It’s fascinating to hear the stories behind game-changing rides like Pirates of the Caribbean and the Matterhorn straight from the mouths of the artists and engineers who helped create them. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, it all comes with a heaping helping of corporate propaganda, with Bassett’s voiceover whitewashing such troubling legacies as [Walt Disney’s well-documented history of union busting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/26/film.usa).

I disagree that The Imagineering Story is ""strictly for Disney superfans."" I'm not a Disney superfan and I still think it's an awesome documentary. Pretty silly criticism to say it shies away from ""Walt Disney’s well-documented history of union busting,"" as the focus of the show is on the **Imagineers** themselves and not Disney's overall history (although there is some of that too, when applicable).

Other than that, I do agree with all of the shows the article recommends. (I haven't seen any of the ones it says to skip. Would love opinions on those!)

Here is the breakdown:

**Watch**

* The Mandalorian
* Noelle
* SparksShorts

**Skip**

* Lady and the Tramp
* Encore
* The World According to Jeff Goldblum
* Marvel’s Hero Project

**Strictly for Kids**

* High School Musical: The Musical: The Series

Upcoming movies coming to Disney+ Hong Kong,"Just found this article and it appears a whole batch of Stephen Chow classics will be heading to Disney+ in Hong Kong this month including A Chinese Odyssey Part 1&2 (12/2), From Beijing with Love, Hail the Judge (12/23) and Tricky Brains (12/30).  

Disney has also bought exclusive streaming rights to Mama's Affair starring boyband Mirror member Keung To and Hard Boiled's Teresa Mo and the new dodgeball comedy ""Life Must Go On"" starring Ekin Cheng.  Personally, I see that as good and bad.  Good because Disney has invested some interest in Hong Kong cinema.  But bad because they will not provide streaming these movies for Chinese communities around the globe.  We're only just getting Limbo on physical media this month all thanks to Disney+. 🤦

Moon Knight The GoldFish Problem (museum display case) Episode One.,"So it looks like Marvel did show us three personalities, remember at the end of the show when Steven just got off work. Then he was heading out when he heard the jackal. When Steven walks past the museum display case, we see two reflections right? But notice that when Steven walks away the reflections stay in place while Steven doesn't have a reflection any more. But you can see Steven's shadow on the statue behind him. Because he is not a vampire so he should have a reflection. So we are guessing that the reflections are Marc (front) and Jake Lockley aka Mr. Knight. (back) Also when you see Steven walking down the hall he has his reflection again.

Please remember we are saying our opinion, not facts, this is what we are guessing what happens by watching the show. For Fans By Fans, ""We Are Comics""

Good Luck Charlie - Amy as a Mother,"Amy as a Mother

As funny as Amy was throughout the show, I think that the writers flanderized her (exaggerated her personality as the show went on).

She just became so much more fame-hungry, egotistical, and narcissistic in Seasons 3 and 4. I recall THREE episodes (Season 1, Season 2, and Season 4) where Teddy is doing a performance (for school or theater) or being interviewed (for Yale) and Amy comes in and tries to take over everything. Eventually, Teddy blows up at her mom for making the entire thing about her (rightfully so), then Teddy goes BACK and apologizes for “hurting her mom’s feelings” and AMY is the one who forgives her (and occasionally she would admit that she had a “tiny” problem with stealing the spotlight) and the cycle continues.

I really wish they handled her plot line of becoming a TV news anchor in Seasons 3 and 4 better, because she honestly changed for the worse IMO.",0,0.5,0,SLEG48,Discussion,0,False,False,text,self.DisneyPlus,1648385263.0,False,False,False,2022-03-27 12:47:43,amy as a mother as funny as amy was throughout the show i think that the writers flanderized her exaggerated her personality as the show went on she just became so much more famehungry egotistical and narcissistic in seasons and i recall three episodes season season and season where teddy is doing a performance for school or theater or being interviewed for yale and amy comes in and tries to take over everything eventually teddy blows up at her mom for making the entire thing about her rightfully so then teddy goes back and apologizes for hurting her moms feelings and amy is the one who forgives her and occasionally she would admit that she had a tiny problem with stealing the spotlight and the cycle continues i really wish they handled her plot line of becoming a tv news anchor in seasons and better because she honestly changed for the worse imo,good luck charlie amy as a mother,1

Seriously? No Logan Noir still?,"When I saw that that and the first two Deadpool films are coming to Disney Plus I was very excited. Not just because of the fact that their inclusion means more mature content coming to the service at all, but the fact that the extra editions would be coming as well. unfortunately that still wasn’t the case with Logan as it still shows the one that has been available on Blu-Ray and digital for awhile now. I was looking forward to watching the Noir version of that more since I really loved how good it looked as a black and white film, but it was nowhere to be seen at all.

And on top of that the extended cut of Deadpool 2 isn’t on there either. It’s just that film’s theatrical cut and nothing else.

This series really deserves to be released along with a sequel or reboot on D+,"As someone who read the comics and saw both seasons of the TV show (hopefully the old seasons come to disney plus as well), this series is really well written and has so much potential. It may look like something that's targeting little kids, but it's actually enjoyable for teens and adults as well. In fact, I saw the TV show the first time when I was in high school and I really enjoyed it. And I saw it again about two years ago with my sister and we had a really good time.

The TV show followed the comics loosely, and the second season ended with a cliffhanger based on the comics, but unfortunately we never got the third season. And the comics had some really interesting ideas that I wish could be explored in a new TV show. I think disney+ is a really good opportunity for series to make a successfull comeback.

So Disney + and the seizure warnings. What did or didn't really need them?,"So this phrase comes up when viewing some of the descriptions on D+ stuff:

""Some flashing lights or sequences may affect photosensitive viewers.""

Now, I know Incredibles 2 definitely needs a warning because of obvious reasons. However, I've been seeing a LOT of the later Marvel movies have this warning, and becuae it never says how bad the strobes actually are, how long, and what types are in them. The decripion never explains for specific movies what the concern is, so anyone seeing this warning who are worried will not want to watch those movies.

But everyone is different. There are some who are fine with gunfire lights being seen if it's not too bright, or neon firing of superpowers (I actually think those are pretty cool) and things that create psychedelic patterns or vortex effects. Some might have no problem with those scenes while others might want to steer clear. Not everything has to be Porygon levels to trigger something (the usual scale of how bad it can get is if it can get to what many consider is one of the worst incidents of this type we've seen in our lifetimes), but not everyone is so photosensitive that they will get triggered by a few shots of gunfire. I guess you have to warn regardless (and I'm glad they do warn).

But they put warnings on Endgame, Captain Marvel, and Thor Ragnarok. Neither of these movies were bad at all for this issue, unless you count the vortex effects or the usual ""Alien"" trope effect where light and electrical things are flickering. Not severe, but someone who can really get triggered easily might have issues, while Incredibles 2 could get to Porygon levels. I didn't see anything bad with the Marvel movies. Heard Doctor Strange (also labeled, though I didn't see that movie) has some problems near the end, but again, if it's anything like the rest of the movies, it's not the harsh type but more of a lot of effects going off at once type and firing of powers that could catch some people off guard but harmless for most people.

So my question (after writing that novel of an explanation) is if you've caught this on a movie you knew for sure needed it, content this is on where you  questioned if it really needed it, and then content that does NOT have this warning that might need it (I know Sleeping Beauty doesn't but that has some rather harsh effects at a few points)?

Luca won’t be in theaters,"So I know that this is old news, but it really annoys me that Luca won’t be in theaters.

Grievous |Disney+ show concept|,"**ROUGH OUTLINE**
**Episode 1 :** We see Grievous' homeworld, and maybe a flashback of him being named/born and getting the name, then back to present and he leads another winning battle against the much stronger species they are going against, seeing win after win, with the episode ending in his father's death, leaving the mask for him. 
**Episode 2:** We see some of their culture - the burials and how they go to the Warrior Heaven. Then he falls in love with the woman (I forgot her name) and (*this is a change to the source, but I think it will make a more impacting story*) then a timejump, to when he has kids with her. The episode ends with a happy family of a veteran warrior
**Episode 3:** Another attack from the seemingly gone oppresors, with now much more advanced weapons, the tribe fights a losing game. The battle keeps on going, and then at the last minute Jedi come, ruin the battle and incidentally kill the tribe, but Grievous and the chief survive. The wounded chief goes with Grievous to the village, expecting medical support.
**Episode 4:** They come back, only to find a burnt down, dilapitated village. Grievous rushes to his house, looking for his wife and kids, but they are nowhere to be found. He rushes back to the fataly wounded chief, who won't survive for much longer and asks him, where to look. He just replies with: ""You must find the bodies, bury them... Or you won't find them on the other side""
**Episode 5:** Grievous starts looking, but after a montage of him going through the whole region, their bodies aren't anywhere. With grief he returns to the village and promises himself to end the Jedi. He finds an unused shuttle of the oppresors and sets his flight to Coruscant. *There is a timejump to Attack of the Clones events, with Grievous seeing the holonet broadcast of the Battle of Geonosis outcome, with many Jedi dead.* He goes looking deeper into it, and finds out Dooku has affiliations with the Banking Clan. He contacts them, and Dooku takes him to a battle as a general, after lookig at his history. He leads battles against the republic winning critical battles, showing how great of a general he is. But in one battle, he gets injured and Dooku escorts him to a Med-Center. He takes this opportunity to turn him into a order obeying machine, without any memory of the past. Then, in a way similar to Revenge of the Sith's Vader operation, General Grievous rises with only one order. Destroying the Republic.

**PROS**: Would develop Grievous' backstory
          Would flesh him out as a character
          A new Disney+ show
          Would please Legends fans

"Moon Knight (""Summon the Suit"") Episode 2","We are theorizing here, let's go back to the point in the episode when. Arthur Harrow sends his police officers to Steven's flat. All first they believe he was Steven Grant until they saw Marc's Passport. Then they didn't believe Steven when he said he is not Marc. 

When they are in the car heading to Arthur Harrow's place. When she was talking about Marc noticed what she said about the archaeologist. Officer Billy look at Steven and said that dark man. Steven said, I didn't do it, Officer Kenny said we know Steven. Like she believes him now. 

The way the officers looked at Steven like that was messed up, feel sorry for Steven, the way Officer Kenny said Steven (We Know Steven)  as she realized after looking at the photo of the archaeologist which we think it is Steven. Also, the way Officer Billy look at Steven when he saw the photo. 

So was guessing that Marc murdered Steven, and Marc was killed don't know-how. Steven is an archaeologist who fought the Khonshu (crescent moon artifact). ""We Are Comics""

This IS the show. The plot is 'adventures of bounty hunter and child on the run'. That's the whole concept of the show. There might be some big revelations near the end but there are only three episodes left, it's not like we are still in the prologue here.

It's not really the type of show that has one continuous story arc, and anything not serving that arc is 'filler'. By that logic 3 of the 5 episodes so far have been 'filler'.

I am making it it's own post in hopes that more people see it.

I live chatted with Disney+ tonight and the representative tells me that these four movies 

* Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties
* White Wilderness
* Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers
* The Shaggy Dog (2006)

Were temporarily removed from the service and are supposed to return. They said they were removed because they needed to fix the movies because of problems reported.

I don't think they are taking back their promise of keeping content on the service and ""out of the vault"". I think this is just a misunderstanding that everyone is jumping to conclusions about and not fact checking before having a meltdown.

LEGO Star Wars: The Chronological Guide No One Asked For,"Out of boredom, I watched The New Yoda Chronicles on Disney Plus this weekend, and had to look up the order, since they are shown as four different specials instead of episodes of a series. It occurred to me that people may not know the proper order to watch them, and how they connect to the larger LEGO Star Wars Universe.

While they obviously conflict with the larger canon, they are mostly consistent between themselves. I've included the canon movies and non-LEGO TV shows as a reference for the timeline and character introductions.

Some of this is not available on Disney Plus (The New Yoda Chronicles is named as it is because The Yoda Chronicles was a Cartoon Network series before Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, even though it is a continuation of that story).

The Empire Strikes Out is the only thing I have an issue with. It contradicts much of The New Yoda Chronicles, but there is a Vader line in that series that references The Empire Strikes Out.

Schoolhouse Rock is up! ALL episodes. Completely jumbled order.,"[Schoolhouse Rock is up!](https://preview.redd.it/kykseykrt1351.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e02c9f9e392acd17ea8112c5945e75085622329)

This is great. I thought it was odd they were only advertising season 1 when the episodes are only a few minutes and there were only like 10 a season. Well, in typical Disney Plus fashion they found a way to muck it up. 6 seasons are up... but listed as one season.

Not only that, the order is completely jumbled. This is worse than their usual jumbling mistakes where it is in ""air order."" The show is completely mixed with episodes that aired in 1994 and 1960s sitting side by side.

Each season had a theme (Multiplication Rock, Grammar Rock, Money Rock, etc). The episodes all have the theme in the title. The themes are mixed across 51 episodes instead of next to each other as they aired so its complete whiplash.

Really, really hope they fix that soon. In addition, 2 episodes are missing.

**Positive:**

"Gaspard Ulliel, Star Of Marvel’s ‘Moon Knight’ Series, Dies Aged 37 After Ski Accident","Very sad news, from [DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2022/01/moon-knight-gaspard-ulliel-hospitalized-ski-accident-1234915133/):

Gaspard Ulliel, one of the bright lights of French cinema and a star of Marvel’s upcoming [Moon Knight](https://deadline.com/tag/moon-knight/) series, has died following a ski accident, according to news agency AFP. He was 37.

The two-time Cesar-winning actor was hospitalized Tuesday after suffering a head injury and did not recover, the actor’s family and local agent said. He was transported by helicopter to a hospital in Grenoble following a collision on the slopes in the Savoie region.

We have reached out to Ulliel’s reps for further details.

Mountain police have been responding to multiple accidents in the region due to hard snow and ice on the slopes. In the Haute-Savoie region, a 5-year-old girl was killed Saturday when a skier crashed into her.

Born on November 25, 1984 in Boulogne-Billancourt, Ulliel is best known for portraying the young Hannibal Lecter in Hannibal Rising and fashion mogul Yves Saint Laurent in the biopic Saint Laurent as well as being the face of the Chanel fragrance Bleu de Chanel.

He was nominated for a Cesar Award for Most Promising Actor in 2002 and 2003. In 2004, Ulliel won that award for his role in A Very Long Engagement, which co-starred Audrey Tautou. In 2017, he won the Cesar Award for Best Actor for his role in Xavier Dolan’s It’s Only the End of the World.

No UI improvements after two years...,"I'm very fond of Disney+. Lots of nostalgia and some of the new shows are good as well. But there has been zero improvement in the UI (on desktop) and it's starting to become annoying. The UI was very basic to begin with. I'm not sure what the Disney+ dev team is doing with their time.

Examples:

- Can't press spacebar to play or pause when fullscreen in Safari. Instead of pausing the video you will drop out of fullscreen.

- No way to select a different episode from within the video player.

- Can't search on actors or genres.

- The languages/audio list takes over the whole screen.

""Please, no"" I thought. ""Anything but customer support. I'll have to wait for an hour to get through, and then talk to someone for another hour and still lose my account.""

"Tired of .. Why isn't ?? here, or, When is ?? coming","Can a Mod make a post and sticky it, so we don't see these every other post? Makes it harder for ppl with tech questions find answers faster, and I'm sure everyone is getting tired of them

There are many reasons why a movie or show isn't here. It hasn't even been out for a full week yet.

Reasons it's not here

1. Currently on a different streaming service
2. To new of a movie or show
3. Not actually a Disney movie/show
4. Disney doesn't own distribution rights
5. Not Family Friendly enough  Family guy  for example
6. Currently be remastered  for release
7. Not in the correct format

Just give it time. Your favorite show or movie will end up sooner or later. All these shows take up storage space. If they were to add everything, that would have delayed it for prob another year. Each TV episode, movie, DVD extra, and trailers are each a different file. It takes time to organize all these files, and as many have noticed, a lot of shows are in the wrong order

To Everyone With Samsung TVs,"I wanted to drop it in the launch thread, but I'm 100% certain it'd be overshadowed. I was able to get the app. It is not findable by searching, but it took me jumping through multiple menus to find it. 

What you're going to want to do is access the App Store. When it loads, scroll down to  ""Group Content"" (you should see a colorful box that starts with Music and Radio), scroll right through subcategories until you hit a selection that says ""Content Previews"". Select that and the first app available for download should be Disney+.

Also. Something else mildly controversial I've seen while looking at threads to see if this was going to be available at launch was that the Samsung TV apps don't support 4K or HDR. To my knowledge. It does. The detail section within the app shows that the programming has 4K Ultra HD and HDR-10 support. I did a Toy Story test run and along with everything looking as clear and vibrant as it should. When I checked my home menu. The settings did show that HDR was in play.

Happy streaming, folks.

Long overdue edit: I should probably start off first by saying. Thanks for the gold, anonymous! 

With that out of the way. For anyone that still checks this thread, I am actually just as perplexed as all of you are that some models of high-end curved TVs and 2016 models seemingly in general don't support 4K HDR. The information has been strangely unclear, but that seems to be more on Samsung's end. 

It's looking like 2017 models and beyond have 4K. 2016 models even on the high end side of things do not and models below that just don't have access period. So. I apologize for any lack of clarity there. On the flipside of things.

Disney Plus ended the Streaming Wars. We lost. The End.,"Excerpts from the article.

The more than 20% hike in prices means Disney+ will now cost twice the original price when the service debuted four years ago, and Hulu’s ad-free tier is now more expensive than the most popular Netflix plan.

Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCU and even Netflix have all raised prices this year in a drive toward profitability. And as Iger announced Wednesday for Disney, password-sharing crackdowns are also en route.

The announcement puts to an end much of the initial allure that led to the popularity of streaming. When Netflix first offered its pioneering service for only $8 a month, millions of people signed up, eager to have access to the company’s expansive catalog for just a fraction of the cost of the traditional cable bundle. That served as the genesis of the streaming era, with legacy entertainment companies such as Disney racing to launch their own direct-to-consumer products at unsustainably low costs.

Now that is all over.

Those massive libraries of content are growing more expensive (not to mention shrinking) by the year. In fact, consumers who bundle just a few streamers together in 2023 will find that the final cost is effectively the same as basic cable. Couple that reality with the introduction of ads into streaming and the end product eerily resembles on-demand cable.

It’s an ironic end to the streaming wars. After pouring billions and billions of dollars into constructing supposedly revolutionary streaming platforms, and decimating the business models that had offered the industry stability for decades, the ultimate product looks awfully similar to what companies and consumers were trying to break free from in the first place.

Disney should now release all of the original movies and series they removed from Disney+ on physical media,"Now that Disney is making the remarkable decision to begin releasing its biggest Disney+ original series from Marvel & Star Wars on physical media, I think it is very important that the Disney+ original movies & tv series that were completely removed from the service get physical releases like this as well.

They have effectively removed all of the artists work from the face of the earth! Most of these had 4K releases on Disney+, but if Disney is concerned about spending a lot to release 4K Ultra HD copies of these movies and series, they should at the very least release them on Blu-Ray & DVD.

Will they all sell as well as the Marvel and Star Wars releases? No. But to at least having them AVAILABLE to watch is incredibly important to ensure that these productions are not erased from existence and to preserve them for future generations. 

What do you think about this?

This is the list of original movies and documentaries that were made for Disney+ that have been removed from the service since June:

- Artemis Fowl
- Better Nate Than Never
