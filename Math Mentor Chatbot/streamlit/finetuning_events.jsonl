Explanation: The common multiples of 4 and 6 are numbers\nthat both 4 and 6 can divide into evenly. The first common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12 (since both 4 and 6\ncan divide into 12 evenly), and the second common multiple is 24 (since both 4 and 6 can divide into 24\nevenly). So, the sum of the first two common multiples of 4 and 6 is 12 + 24 = 36. However, this is not\none of the options given. There seems to be a mistake in the problem. The correct answer should be\n36, not 48. The other options are incorrect because they do not equal the sum of the first two common\nmultiples of 4 and 6.

The other options are incorrect because 1 and 2 are in the hundreds and tens places\nrespectively before the decimal point, and 4 is in the thousandths place after the decimal\npoint.,Difficulty Level: AO1,Topic: Numbers\n\npage_label: 62\nfile_name: /Users/miskhander/Dropbox/00 Data Science/GA Hmk Submissions/capstone/streamlit/data/data.pdf\n\nQuestion: In 89.76, which digit is in the tenths place?,Options: (1) 6 (2) 7 (3) 8 (4) 9,Solution: The\nbest answer is (2) 7.

Explanation: To find 80% of 160, you multiply 160 by 0.80 (which is the decimal equivalent of\n80%). 160 * 0.80 = 128 So, 80% of 160 is 128.

Explanation: 72 hundreds means 72*100 = 7200. 16 ones\nmeans 16*1 = 16. If you add these two values together, you get 7200 + 16 = 7216. However, the\nquestion asks for the value of 72 hundreds and 16 ones, not their sum. A hundred is a unit that\nrepresents 100, and one is a unit that represents 1. So, 72 hundreds is 72*100 = 7200, and 16 ones is\n16*1 = 16. The value of 72 hundreds and 16 ones is therefore 7200 + 16 = 7216. So, the correct\nanswer is (1) 7216, not (2) 880, (3) 736, or (4) 88.

Explanation: When rounding to the nearest hundredth, we\nlook at the digit in the thousandths place. If this digit is 5 or more, we round up. If it's less than 5, we\nround down. In this case, the digit in the thousandths place is 6, which is more than 5. Therefore, we\nround up the hundredths place (3) to 4. So, 3.836 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 3.84. The other\noptions are incorrect because they do not accurately represent 3.836 rounded to the nearest\nhundredth. 3.8 (option 1) and 3.83 (option 2) are rounded down too much, and 3.90 (option 4) is\nrounded up too much.,Difficulty Level: AO1,Topic: Numbers\n\npage_label: 49\nfile_name: /Users/miskhander/Dropbox/00 Data Science/GA Hmk Submissions/capstone/streamlit/data/data.pdf\n\nQuestion: Round 16 641 to the nearest hundred.,Options: (1) 16000 (2) 16600 (3) 16700 (4)\n17000,Solution: The best answer is (2) 16600. Explanation: When rounding to the nearest hundred,\nwe look at the tens place. If the tens digit is 5 or more, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down.\nIn 16 641, the tens digit is 4, which is less than 5. Therefore, we round down to the nearest hundred,\nwhich is 16600. The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly round 16 641 to the\nnearest hundred. 16000 and 17000 are too far away, and 16700 would be the result if we were\nrounding up, but we are rounding down in this case.,Difficulty Level: AO1,Topic: Numbers\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Round off 4.267 to the nearest hundredth.

When rounding to the nearest hundredth, we look at the digit in the thousandths place. If this digit is 5 or more, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down.
